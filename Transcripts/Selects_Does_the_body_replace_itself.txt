Hey everybody, it's your old pal Josh, and for this week's Selective Chosen, does the body replace itself every seven years? Sounds like a medical episode and it kind of is, but after a little while it turns into a brain buster of a headscratcher, of a philosophical bent that I think you're going to love. I hope you enjoy the living heck out of it. Welcome to Stuff You Should Know, a production of I Heart Radio. Hey and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark with Charles W. Chuck Bryant and guest producer Noel. Noel's in the house. It's the end of the new studio. Yeah, and his place is comfy, cozy. I like it. I wish there was a chair version of a waterbed. I know, this is a nampish little place. Yeah, especially the company comes from dragging old apologies. Yeah, same here. So if we're talking kind of slow or low or we just stop talking for a little while, it's, where's tired? Yeah, bumped into you at the Hawks Game last night. I know. Hey how many of you are on that? Yeah. The bump in. Yep. We're both at the Hawks Game in the Hawks One. Didn't even know we were going. Look over in a line. There's Josh and you and me. Yeah. That's great. There's Chuck and Eddie. Yep. It's a fantastic day together. And a arena of 18,000 bump into someone. Is that it? That's all it holds? I think it's something like that. It's a good lot of people. It's a good arena. Yeah, but you had box seats because you're special. They were free. I hope my word free too. I don't know what to do with the new one. Yeah, I've never seen a new one. Yeah, it's not too bad. I was laughing about the new one. But then I got up there. I was like, this is great. Yeah. You can see everything. Did you know it was actually bleed? Just twice. Yeah. Once out of a cheer excitement. Right. And then once from the altitude. And that was more of a spray. Yeah. Just covering everyone. Yeah. It was like, go Hawks. Boy, what a weird intro. But I mean, it kind of jibes a little bit. Yeah. Because we're talking, yeah. You're mentioning blood. Sure. I was shedding cells and blood. You were like blood is made up of cells and we shed tons of cells. But before we get to that, right? There's the fact that the podcast you shed cells. I want to mention this one thing I read. Yeah. It's called, I think the title of the article is The Self is Moral. Yeah. It's about like where we get our identity of self from. Like where it's rooted. It was written by a person named Nina Strowmyer, I believe, is on Aion magazine. Yeah. Just type in the self as Moral. Aion. It'll come up. That'll catch you there. And toward the beginning, the author says, there's this very famous philosophical exercise, which you know, philosophers love to do mental exercises. Yeah. That's what it has. So imagine you have like, kind of a kind of, you know. Imagine you have like a ship, right? Okay. Like a boat. Yeah. Nice Yankee Clipper. Okay. And this Yankee Clipper is slowly over time, kind of salvage for parts. Okay. But rather than just being stripped, like every time a part is taken out, it's replaced. Yeah. And then over the course of like 50, 100 years, as each plank, as each bolt, as each like, mast head, even the thing that carved lady in front. Yeah. Eventually just gets replaced with something else. Yeah. A new carb lady that speaks of the time. Right. You know? Is it still though after every single part has been replaced, the same ship that it was before? Yeah. I see what you mean. I don't think that can be possible. Why not? Especially if it has the same name. And it's the same ship in the same place as before. It was just slowly over time. Yeah. It moved out. True. Where does the self lie? Yeah. That's a good point, man. Like reading a house, same thing. Yeah. I mean, like all the floors and the walls and the windows, like, when does it cease to become that same house that was built in 1930? Exactly. Isn't that cool? Yeah. It is really cool. And the reason that it applies to this episode is because over the course of your lifetime, a significant portion, pretty much all of the cells in your body, are going to be replaced so that the person, even after you reach your adult self, yeah, physically. By the time you die, assuming you're going to die much later, you are essentially a different person, at least on the cellular level. Yeah. 37 trillion cells. Is that how many we have? Yeah. That's what they estimate. They're like, well, looking into life spans. It sounds like an estimate. 37 trillion. Yeah. What do you want? Like they're like, give or take. Yeah. I did a little research into life spans just because this all sort of comes back to like your death basically. Yeah. Is that's all death is is your cells, you know, dying. Little by little. Well, yeah. I mean, if you think about it, Chuck, one of the things that like, why do we die if we're going to die? We'll get to all that. Oh, okay. But it's intriguing, you know, it is. It started, you know, questions started popping up. So apparently we gain about three months, every three months of life, humanity, every year that we progress. Like the average lifespan expands by three months. Yeah. Like if you were born in 2012, the average lifespan is now. And this is the United States is 78.8. I mean, in 1991, it was about 47 and 50 years. For men and women respectively. But if you look at the ratio, it's still about three months, despite all our technologies. Three months, a year, every year, every year. It's just slowly creeping along. Yeah cause the, the think of article that it was like, when we're going to live to be 100 by average, and they say by the year 2100, if things hold, then the average human or American will be about a hundred years old. I thought that so I guess I would be on if things are steadily progressing. I had heard that like our Generation would be either the last or the first the last to not hit triple digits or the first two on average Yeah, yeah, yes, yes, yes, you know So who knows plus if you believe in like Think speeding Science speeding up. Yeah, what is that Moore's law? He has at it. Yeah I applied to computers though and that's right right right, but I mean you can Extr-fended other stuff. Yeah, then you might think you know, it's it's but You know, they say it's not increasing like that. No, at least not so far more as law is Exponential growth just adding three months every years Yeah, non-exponentials. Do you have metric? I think we're still at non-exponential growth definitely yeah We're just adding three months Yeah, it's not bad though. That's pretty good average every four years That's an extra year. Yeah, well, in this session you think about you know people that were born You know a lot of our colleagues like eight years behind us We're going to live an average of two years longer Yeah That seems unfair. Yeah, I know what did they do just serve that we're We're thinking about our own deaths today. Yeah, um and check that there's this rumor theory Legend maybe okay that your body regenerates itself 95% of your body regenerates itself every year Yeah, that's not true. No, it's not true, but it was a very long standing rumor and it was actually based on science Yeah, you know, not just the idea that oh yeah ourselves regenerates so Back at the envelope Estimate is that you know, we regenerate 95 or 98% of ourselves every year It was early experimentation by injecting um radio active isotopes into human beings Yeah, and then following their course and then making estimates based on that Lead to this idea. It's called pulse labeling is it? Yeah, it's like tagging an animal in the wild basically right, but you're just tagging a cell Yeah, specific types of cells. Yeah, they don't do that to humans anymore. No, they do animals anything It's a very dumb thing to do sure Injecting radiation exactly yeah unless of course, you know, it's radiation treatment That's true, which is still a really weird thing if you think about it. It's yeah, I have a feeling it's gonna be like one of the things we look back on It's like a primitive treatment. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I hope so But there there was this long standing science for decades or this idea scientific idea that We regenerated ourselves by 95 98% finally and I think 2005 and There was a a researcher named Dr. Jonas Friesen. He's sweet as she's a It's awesome. He said this whole urban legend is really bringing me down I want to figure out a way to really track how often the human body regenerates itself Yeah, and the biggest question has been the brain Specifically the cerebral cortex and the heart and the heart muscles I mean they want to know all this stuff, but those were the two biggest mysteries I think right there's still the mysteries But if you went back to prior to 2005 and Dr. Friesen's research it was all a mystery. Yeah, he figured out He basically put a very accurate timestamp on how often human tissue and human cells regenerate themselves. Yeah, so the way he did this is very clever For a long time botanists knew that the trees around the world contained a spike of carbon-14 radiation. Yes, thanks to humans and nuclear bombs Exactly from 1954 to 1963 Trees rings for tree growth around the world Show a big spike in carbon-14 carbon-14 is naturally occurring too So like just cosmic rays from the sun bombard Earth's atmosphere and Create radioactive isotopes by knocking electrons from particles in Earth's atmosphere right Those radioactive particles become carbon-14 which is radioactive and in the atmosphere carbon-14 binds to oxygen and creates Carbon dioxide which comes to Earth every living thing Breeds this stuff in whether it's a plant whether it's a human yeah like we just have See 14 in our bodies and we also eat plants exactly contain the C14 and the sides breathing it in and we also eat the animals that eat the plants that In just see 14 right yeah, so like we got carbon 14 in our bodies, that's right But because of the spike in carbon-14 that was introduced to the atmosphere from nuclear testing yeah There there is a spike in humans as well So you can roughly age like a human compared to another human If they were born in say 1959 and one who's born in 1970 after there was that spike of carbon-14 a gone away right right That's pretty cool, but what Dr. Friesen did is even cooler He basically went back to those tree trunks those tree rings that show a spike in carbon-14 and created a calendar That's so awesome. I've carbon-14 decay and Basically said okay on this date This is how much carbon-14 was on Earth yeah and If I take this cell and compare it knowing that carbon-14 decays it a constant rate yeah I can tell you exactly how old the cell is exactly and he used it to date cells and tissues and all sorts of cool stuff yeah he went looking for a marker And he found one due to our atomic testing program. Yeah, which is pretty weird Just released all that junk in the atmosphere and now all these years later it has a nice use Yeah, you know it does so we now know when we're gonna die right sort of and the the reason he was able to use this as a marker Chuckers is that When you when you take a breath of life your first breath of life that's right and you get some You get some of that C14 into your DNA and a steady amount stays in there like you don't keep ingesting C14 as far as I understand as far as your DNA goes Okay, once it's in your DNA as Your cells divide yeah that original amount becomes divided evenly right so the less C14 that's in tissue the older those that cell line is right within the younger the actual cells are right Is that right I think so which would mean the new cell the marker would be a fresh batch of the C14 no it have less C14 oh really yeah Let's say you have because the cell divided yes exactly yeah like you have 10 grams of C14 which you don't Imagine that would be like let's say you're your one cell that's never divided has 10 yeah when it divides into two Each of those two cells is gonna have five Great and then two and a half and then one point seven five and so on and so on So since you know that C14 is generated at a counter rate You know that it decays at a half life of fifty seven hundred and thirty years yeah You can look at the the amount of C14 and then also the decay of it as well yeah you can date things that are no longer living too To see when the when they ingested that C14 was yeah he's a little like a bingo card He just from the calendar that he made of the trees and he holds it up in the light and that's how he determines it It's not true, but what he did determine that was which is really cool and this is sort of what we've been building toward is that Most of your cells are about seven to ten years old yes and the body and there are variances and of course We're gonna talk about all that and right after this break we're going to give you a little primer on cells So you know what all this means, all right You Hi, I'm Kristen Bell getting help from my anxiety made me feel like myself again, but we have all sorts of reasons for putting off taking care of ourselves I thought I could just keep pushing through my depression symptoms Let's push through dinner with the in-laws not life. I don't want medication to change who I am understood, but what if it helps you feel like yourself again? I hope my depression would just go away after a while same But for me it was kind of like wishing away my taxes.

Oh, yeah, that's right there tiny You need a microscope to see them and it's like it's the tiniest thing that can still reproduce yeah, and even though we have many different kinds of cells I think 200 types And within those cells there are differences, but there are a lot of similarities with all cells Right in their structure Namely they have a cell membrane they have a nucleus have a nucleus. I'm a more than one And these membranes are what allows nutrients to pass in and out waste to pass out Water through osmosis travels in Reverse osmosis Travels out yeah, and What else we got you're mitochondrion as well? That's where this is the important really important thing which is Basically what keeps your cells alive. That's the power center, right? Yeah, and that's You know your cells need food to live just like your body does, but you can't pass that that hamburger Straight into your cell right it needs to be broken down so yourself can use it exactly into what adenosine triphosphate ATP is like the the Universal cell fuel right yeah, so There's a lot of stuff that the body does make I think you need like 23 I think you need 23 amino acids and like nine of them your body doesn't really manufacture So those are the nine non essential amino acids right and you use amino acids to build proteins and Use proteins for everything from Making muscles to making red blood cells to Your mounting and immune response proteins are very very vital In some of them you have to build by eating stuff from your environment, right? Yeah So you go out and you find yourself a nice pig and you cut off its back leg you say sorry pig Here's a pig leg for you, but I need this leg I'm gonna eat this leg and what I'm really eating is the muscle when I'm really really eating is the glutamine And in my body is going to take this glutamine it can make it itself, but it doesn't hurt to have an extra little bit of glutamine Yeah, then hurt to have that pig leg in exactly right so I'm chomping on the pig leg You know the pigs are much easier in the nurse leg way right just use your imagination for second sure And yes, I'm sorry too. Yeah, so you're eating the pig leg and you're gaining this glutamine as a result And your body's metabolizing the glutamine and then reusing it, right? Yeah, and it can be glutamine it can be Anything we if we're ingesting a protein if we're ingesting amino acids or if we're eating any kind of food Sugar is whatever our bodies break it down into its constituent parts and then a lot of those constituent parts Become part of our bodies Yeah, so if you think about it in this sense when we eat when we breathe We're taking in stuff we need from the environment yeah and that stuff that we take in from the environment becomes a part of us Literally physically on the molecular level. Yeah, it becomes a part of us for better or worse depending on what it is of course Yeah, that's a great I think that's ultimately one of the side lessons of this whole thing is we should take care of our environment Yeah, because that environment becomes us and we either suffer or thrive as a result of it You ever heard the expression you are what you eat exactly, you know, you literally are what you eat quite literally And then also check it goes it goes the other way as well when we excrete waste when we exhale CO2 yeah, that's taken up by other things in the environment's deposited into the environment and it becomes part of the environment itself Yeah, so not only do we regenerate our cells regenerate tissue every on average seven to ten years become Almost wholly a new version of ourselves. Yeah, um We also the boundary between us and the surrounding environment is Really non-existent because there's a constant exchange of molecules. Yeah, we lose on average. They say 90 the average adult male is is 96 million cells per minute but we also Replace those at the rate of 96 million per minute. Yeah, roughly yeah, yeah So that's the good news so we've got all these cells that we're losing and we've got all these new cells that are replacing them And I think like you said earlier before the break that these the different types of cells and then hence different tissues Regenerated a different rate right? Yeah, and they all have specialized jobs and the cells are often Built in such a way to aid that job Physically, you know different to make that job easier, which is really cool too. Right. She was a versatile they are Yes, you know like stem cells are very versatile super So let's say you're skin yeah, you're skin regenerates every two to four weeks I think yeah Exactly you get a new healthy coating of skin every two to four weeks because your epithelial cells are particularly good at regenerating themselves That's right and that is um Well, I guess that would fall on the low side Obviously if we're talking seven to ten years on the super low side You have the cells that line like you're in test and you've got and Those things don't last long at all because it's such a harsh environment, you know You would expect them to last like weeks and in months and years I think they want it five days. Yeah, that's nothing but the structure of your guts the that are Beneath that membrane lining that turns over five days They last about 15 years. Yeah, it's such a like a Beautiful elegant System yeah that we have right to keep us alive Red blood cells last about 120 days But then you have things like cells in your bone Which actually regenerate as well so your bones are or over time over much longer period of time Actually becoming I mean I hate to call them new bones, but the kind of are you know Well, yeah, I mean compared if you took your femur And somehow compared it to your femur when you were 15 years old like they are two totally different bones Even though they're your bones. Yeah, they were in the same place going in the same person with the same DNA There's still different bones Yeah, that's they're made of different cells 10 years or so for the bones. Yeah something like that for the human skeleton 300 to 500 days for the liver Very important organ it is and one of the other cool things about the liver is it's just gangbusters that regenerating itself You can apparently cut out 95% of a person's liver and it will grow back and it you won't have full function, but it will function You'll survive with just 5% of your liver. That's pretty amazing actually. Yeah because it will just grow right back kind of like a hornet's nest Interestingly the interlens cells of your eye Form in your embryo and basically don't change Yeah, now is that why you have a suffer from Degeneration and vision that's what I would guess that the reason yes So with the corneal lens Chuck when you when you're born when you're conceived Right you are a cell Gross that divide Finally once that first division takes place those corneal cells They're set in stone like your corneal cells are as old as you are Same age as you other cells that make up different parts of the eyes. They're far newer, but your corneal cells Your cerebral cortex cells, they think yeah, that's the one I mentioned the brain and the heart muscles those are the two big ones because obviously The reason we have Diseases like Alzheimer's and dementia are because the cerebral cortex Has long thought to not regenerate cells at all yeah now I think they believe that They do in a very small number or different regions like the old factory bulbs supposedly does Yeah, in the hippocampus so we can learn new thing or there since a smell can be refined over time Yeah, and I think isn't that also the reason the smell Is very much tied to your memory? Probably like a smell can conjure up a memory more clearly Yeah, but the the cerebral cortex itself they don't think Who was her name Elizabeth Gould Princeton did a lot of work on this because It was just basically set in stone for years like now doesn't happen and she did a lot of work over the years trying to prove That it did Using tracer studies and I think that where they are now as they think it does some yeah Here they're here there, but obviously we still have to mention Alzheimer's so it's not It doesn't regenerate like the rest of the body nine clothes yeah all's Humber is also maybe produced I guess by plaques and we're plaque build up In between your neurons that keep them from firing as well. Yeah, that's it seems like we're so close to figuring out The secret you know yeah to uh I don't know about not dying ever I'm not talking immortality, but um Living much longer lives. Well, let's talk about that because all of this stuff Kind of leads to that question if we regenerate so often why do we die and we'll address that right after this Hi, I'm Kristen Bell getting help from my anxiety Made me feel like myself again, but we have all sorts of reasons for putting off taking care of ourselves I thought I could just keep pushing through my depression symptoms Let's push through dinner with the in-laws not life. I don't want medication to change why I am understood, but what if it helps you feel like yourself again?

Yeah, it's What they think is it has to do with your DNA actually in the cell Our cells as we age even the new ones to get replaced which really stinks. Yeah, uh become what they call Sinescent which means that they can't divide any longer. We've talked about the hayflick limit before or Reply-cative sentences basically how many times your cells can divide over its lifetime Yeah, and I think like a fiber-oblast which is cells of the connective tissue in mammals is about 50 cell divisions Yeah, and then it hits that point of sense and it starts sending out repair signals to your body That aren't necessary and that causes inflammation and we've talked about inflammation kind of being the source of most Most of the original problems that will eventually lead to your death. Yeah, you know Something becomes inflamed and leads to all kinds of problems. There's no repair needed. So it's a fall signal So they're trying to come up with drugs now There's one called a repimicene that tries to stop the cells from sending out those false signals Which is amazing. Yeah, that would be wonderful. You know There's another explanation for it as well as that when our cells divide Especially over time as we age they're basically making photo copies of themselves Yeah, and you ultimately years down the road end up making photo copies of photo copies Right and those don't tend to pan out very well So as far as analogies go that one kind of makes sense that yes, we have brand new cells But the DNA copies the DNA blueprints that they're based on Have seem better days. Yeah many years back. You know, yeah, that makes sense. It's good way to say it We also talked a little bit about whether or not The heart muscle itself replenishes itself in the cells And for a long time they had no idea But um now Thanks to our buddy Dr. Frisson He his pretty much I don't think we said what his Who he works with did we? No he works with the with a K Carolin Schotteme. Oh, yeah Just like incredible Scientists that are making like amazing Advancements and trying to figure this stuff out But they did in fact find that the heart does replace itself The muscle cells about 1% of the heart muscles replaced every year at age 25 And that falls over your lifetime to less than half a percent per year by the age 75 I spoke too soon that does make sense. Yeah, so what they basically said is About half of your heart's muscle cells will be exchanged during a normal lifetime Okay, which is okay? It is but is it slowing down over time? I mean the heart's kind of essential Yeah, but they're hoping again to develop drugs that can accelerate that process too. Yeah, I don't know how far along they're on that But that'd be amazing So there's this whole thing that kind of came up to me, man like that. I don't All of this raises this question to me, right? Yeah, if you look at like you or me or any living thing as As an investment like a molecular investment in The ability to reproduce, right? Okay, once you finish your reproductive Age yeah Then it does make sense that you would just kind there would be built in this Mechanism of of aging and then death and then decay which is what we do yeah We return back to the earth to put it in kind of biblical terms There's like that whole ashes that ashes dust to dust thing. Sure. It is very very true and if you look at Us and you look at all living things as Something that exchanges molecules with the external environment takes them in puts them out, right? And you look at us as all connected in that sense. Yeah, like we're just like a plant Exactly or we're just like a rock. Yeah, like we're all that stuff and those things are us because we're able to exchange Basic ingredients Then it makes total sense that a person would come together be conceived start dividing his cells You know make more of itself and then start to age and then die into K and then it would give something else a chance to come up from that again, right? Sure, but then it makes you it makes you wonder what's the point of that? What I mean like think about it if we're just the same as plants like why are we all here? Yeah Like if we're if the whole point is to just basically recycle materials because we are just recycling Stuff from the environment and we're recycled as we die into K. Yeah, what is the point? Is our point just to Be part of the carbon cycle so we're moving carbon in and out of ourselves and in and out of the environment moving it around Or I don't understand what the point is of life. I guess is what I'm saying here. Nile us No, I'm not saying I don't believe that there isn't a point. I'm just curious what it is Yeah, because it because if we are the same as any other living thing and the the definition of living is an Exchange with an active exchange with the surrounding environment breathing through eating whatever including yes, then And then if you kind of take that a little further and say well clearly We're meant to like reproduce or something like that and then after that we age and die What's the what's the point like why not just have one species of living thing yeah and just let that Do all of your carbon recycling or whatever? Yeah, I think are you about to quit the show? Yeah, see what you mean like If we look at ourselves as a purely mechanical Serving a purely mechanical function right on the planet like we are to the carbon cycle what say evaporation is to Rain cycle yeah like we're a means of moving something along well I think that's when you Man this is getting philosophical I think that's when you start getting into questions of The soul well, yeah, I mean it kind of makes you wonder like well Why would there be more than one species it would be much more efficient it just have one maybe two there's all these different ones So why yeah the fact that that why is just sitting there and flashing neon lights definitely made me Wonder basically the opposite it's made me think in a different direction than nihilistically right in a like we're only here for so long and so if there the point is to Like make the most of your time well I think that's a separate that's a separate okay part of it Yeah because no matter what conclusion you come to whether nope We're just a means of recycling carbon and that is it yeah Kind of like a guy a theory view of things right or if you say no like the the the fact that we're Inefficient and redundant as far as that carbon recycling thing goes yeah suggests that maybe there is a higher purpose to us Either way I feel like you come to the conclusion or you should come to the conclusion that The one thing we do know is that we are here right now and the best thing we can do is is make the absolute best of it for ourselves and for other people as well Yeah, and there are probably others out there that think the whole point is to make as much cash as you can sure can buy products That rubber nails probably say that yes, you Man he'd live that way then Man that's interesting. I think we should I'd love to tackle something philosophical and deep like the soul meaning of life Yeah, that'd be tough. I mean that'd be cool though. It would be cool. We don't delve into that very much. No, we should I'd like to do that and Consciousness that's a really interesting one too Like it doesn't make any sense. It's a very trippy way forward for this show. Yeah, we'll get to start getting weird I took a lot of acid this morning, so I If you want to know more about some just weird trippy stuff How stuff works has a Surprising amount of it on there I don't know just tried typing the word trippy into the search bar you can also type does your body really Replaced itself every seven years or no bring up this cool article and I think I said search bar at some point in time So how about some less than your mail I like how you specify that you took a lot of acid not just a little yeah a lot of it All right, I'm gonna call this multiple we had we got like a bunch of emails in one day About people picking at our grammar and things. Oh, yeah, so I'm just excited to read three of them because they're short Okay, hey guys, I generally enjoy the episodes, but You do have one issue with Your grammar and now I'm a verb agreement you tend to say There are many lines of evidence or there's lots of experiment showing Instead of there are not there is When the pronoun refers to a plural subject check yourselves next time guys You typically make them steak about 10 times every show Why'd you go recycle some carbon pal? That's from Ken Keller and simple terrace Florida Thank you I always like to pick apart their emails too About because people usually make a mistake or do in their own emails Hey guys, this is from Blair love the show. I hate to be nitpicky They always say they don't yeah right before they nitpick But I have a grammar correction It's been bugging me for months and stone hinge was a major fender at least one of you not naming names Frequently used the word further when you really mean farther The latter term is used for literal distances Further is only supposed to be figuratively Didn't know that okay, so thanks Blair yeah and then last one fill Who is an English and grammar? Pronunciation freak he says hey guys when there's an Italian word you take your time to pronounce it properly Same with Japanese and the far east and general so why don't you extend that same courtesy to English words?
