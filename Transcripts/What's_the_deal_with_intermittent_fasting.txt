Welcome to Stuff You Should Know. A production of I Heart Radio. Hey and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh and there's Chuck and Jerry's here too, and this is Stuff You Should Know. I can't believe how good you've gotten at this after 15 years. Oh yeah, thank you. It's amazing. I've had a lot of practice. Pull something like that out here. 16 years in, 15, whatever it is. Sure. I mean, I'm full of surprises I like to think. Speaking of surprises, we want to issue a little COA right off the bat here. Good idea. In a little trigger warning, this topic is about intermittent fasting. And you know, there's just a lot of baggage wrapped up anytime you're talking weight loss and diet techniques and especially fasting. If you've ever struggled with disorder eating, fasting can be very problematic, obviously, even intermittently. So, and there's just a lot of emotion and feelings wrapped up in all this stuff. So we just want to let people know if the title didn't give it away. We're going to talk about the ins and outs and the science of intermittent fasting. Yeah. I've had disorder eating pretty much my whole life and when I tried intermittent fasting, it really set it off. Oh, really. Interesting. Yeah, for sure, unfortunately. And I also noticed I kind of plateaued really quickly because I was using until there's weight. But one of the things I didn't realize Chuck is that I guess I did kind of realize it, but it's not at the forefront of your mind. There's a lot of other reasons besides weight loss that people engage in intermittent fasting based on some studies that have come down the pike over the last couple of decades. And especially the last decade that's show, it's quite conceivable that if you engage in intermittent fasting for a prolonged period of time, all sorts of health markers like blood cholesterol, blood sugar, insulin resistance, all this stuff can really improve. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But you know, as we'll see, studies are problematic when it comes to intermittent fasting because there's been so many of them. A lot of them have been on mice. A lot of them. Some of them have been on humans, but with any kind of diet studies like humans sticking to a diet is tough. So it's hard to get accurate results and results study why it's been kind of mixed. And it also, the, and the, the, the Grabstre helped us put this one together, but as it also points out that the media comes into play. So six, eight, ten years ago, even five years ago intermittent fasting was the cool awesome, amazing new thing. And just in the past couple of years, I've even noticed that it's like, well, I'm not so sure about this. Yeah. Um, is there, is there correct to like, I have not noticed that, I guess, I have no shame. Yeah. So people are poop-pooing it. Yeah. I think, but you know, I think it's like, any diet fad kind of goes out of favor, trend-wise. And then I think there are some people in the media who will then report on like only the negative studies and not like, hey, overall, it looks like this or that. I think it's possible that that's what triggers the negativity toward the diet trend. It's possible. So chicken or the egg kind of thing, like, does the media start poop-pooing it or does the start poop-pooing it and then it's true. Other one picks it up. Muckier? So, uh, for those of you who have never tried intermittent fasting, that's one of the things. So many people have tried intermittent fasting because it's really, really easy to start. But for those of you who aren't familiar with it, totally cool, we're going to explain it a little bit. But essentially intermittent fasting is not so much watching what you eat or even necessarily how many calories you eat, although both of those are supposed to be wrapped up in it. But the thing that really differentiates IF for those in the know, um, from other types of, uh, caloric restriction diets, is that the time you eat or the amount of time over the course of a day that you eat is really what's, what's important here. Yeah, and we'll probably hammer this home a lot. But while you said and even COA had already that not necessarily counting your calories, that doesn't mean, hey, I got eight hours a day to stuff my face with whatever I want to. You're still supposed to eat a healthy diet. Uh, there is no way to be healthy and drop weight without a healthy diet. Let's just say that across the board. Yep. Right. Uh, but with intermittent fasting or IF, as you said, um, there's a few different sub types. Uh, the first is also known sometimes as time restricted eating or time restricted feeding, which sounds weird because I don't have some big giant grown-up that comes in and feeds me. I don't know about here. Why not? It's yuck. That would be pretty great. Here comes the plane. Uh, but this is when you sort of divide your day up into, um, eating hours and not eating hours. And even within that, there are different, ways to do it. But one of the most common that you'll see online if you look up, uh, you'll see the number 16 colon eight. And that is 16 hours, um, off and eight hours where you can eat. And, uh, that's, you know, you, if you're just a regular daytime worker who sleeps at night, the good news about this one is about half the time that you're not supposed to be eating, you'll should be sleeping. Yeah, because it's the thing we all fast anyway from the, when we sleep, we're fasting. Yeah. This is just kind of extending it a little more, making it a little more deliberate. Unless you sleepwalk in the eat. That's true. For it. Yeah. If you're on ambian and eat butter, yeah, ambian. I could remember which one it was. There's a few variations of this that, like you said, I'll fall into time restricted feeding or diet. Um, I've heard 16 eight more than anything to just kind of encompass this whole, this whole category. But there's like 14 10, there's O-mad, which is, stands for one meal a day. Um, essentially what you're doing is you're just limiting how much you eat. Again, when you eat, it's sensible and that in doing that, you're, you're fasting intermittently. You're doing it every day. So the intermittent fast takes place over the course of 24 hours, not necessarily anything longer than that. That's right. Uh, the next way you might hear, um, uh, as a way to go about it, it's pretty common is five colon two. Uh, and these are days of the week instead of hours this time. So that means that for five days of the week, you're pretty much eating your normal diet again, hopefully, uh, that should be a good, healthy diet. Uh, and then on those two days, you're either not eating it all, uh, or you're eating really, really, really low calories. Like, I've seen 200 to 600 calories a day. Um, and you probably shouldn't do this two days in a row, but I'm sure some people do it two days in a row. You do actually don't really want to do it two days in a row. There's no benefits to it, and it can actually be counterproductive because as we'll see, you can enter what's called colloquially a starvation mode where your body starts hanging on to fat stores, um, and slows your metabolism, which is the opposite of what you want if you're, um, intermittent fasting for weight loss. So you really don't want to go beyond 24 hours, but you just do two days out of every seven and just non-consecutively. Yeah, because if you like you said that starvation mode, your body thinks, you must be lost in the woods or the desert or something, right? Uh, because you're not smuck alive. Yeah, you're not putting anything in me. So, uh, I'm going to slow things down. Metabolism once. Right. Uh, the third one is called the fasting mimicking diet or FMD. It's also sometimes called the warrior diet. I had never heard of this one. It's essentially like a time-restricted one, but really what you're just doing is eating one, like, decent-sized meal, but again, really, um, well put together, like, fats and proteins and vegetables and stuff like that. But it's a good-sized meal toward the end of the day. And then throughout the day, maybe you're nibbling on some other, like, vegetables and nuts or something like that. So again, it's time-restricted, but the emphasis of this is to, like, keep up your nutrients just enough so that you can, um, stay ripped, like, if you're an athlete or you're, uh, really into exercising, but you want an intermittent fast for other health benefits. This is probably the one that you should do. Because we should say it's no joke that when you fast, especially if you fast more than 24 hours, you start to feel a little weak. You start to get some brain fog. You start to notice that you are definitely not up to snuff. Yeah. So you want to be up to snuff if you're training, but you still want an IF or your diet, friend. That's right. Uh, so Ed points out and we should also um, reiterate that fasting means that you're not consuming calories. Uh, you want a drink water. You want to drink a lot of water and you can also drink coffee, you can also drink tea. You can't dump a bunch of sugar in cream or in it. But people also, uh, modify IF a little bit and be like, all right, you know what, uh, I'm going to eat a little bit of yogurt at the morning or I'll put, you know, I'll have a couple of carrots at noon or maybe I'll have that creamer in the coffee. So like a little bit of calories coming in, um, but it's that still sort of generally considered a fast. Right. That was, I couldn't do that. Like I could coast for a very long time if I just didn't eat. I can do that too. Once I started eating, it was all over. Like I just wanted to eat everything in sight. So I would put off eating as long as possible. I'm kind of the same way. I think there's a misconception like when someone like me has extra pounds that I just like eat off the time and I don't. I can go a long, long time without eating and I'm fine. I'm not like, oh, I'm hungry. Uh, and I don't think it's just like mind over matter. I just, I can do that. It's, I have a terrible metabolism, awful genetics and I'm learning now to eat the right foods, but, um, I think when, uh, just don't judge people. If you see someone that's so way, it doesn't mean that they just constantly are stuffing their face because it's not the case. Yeah. I mean, even if they are, who the heck are you to judge them? Like leave them alone. Yeah, shut up anyway. Yeah. They're either living their best life or they have a terrible burden to bear in either way, just leave them alone. Yeah. I think that's a great stuff. You should know T-shirt is on the front. Shut up anyway. I don't own the back. Just leave them alone. That's right. So new motto. I love it. We need a colon in between the two. Yeah, between everything. So, um, do you want to talk about the whole idea behind this? Yeah. All right. So, fasting basically is based on the idea that when we metabolize, um, energy, it usually comes from the food we just ate. And if we have some leftover, some of that glucose is really what it breaks down to, um, is stored in our muscles, it's something called glycogen, which is a really quick available burst of energy that we can release if we need be. And then beyond that, once our, those glycogen stores are replenished, it could be converted to fat for like long term storage, basically. That's the way you can look at it. If you don't eat, then you don't have that initial amount of energy to burn through to power you through the day. So, you have to go from the beginning to your glycogen stores, which you can burn up quite quickly if you're exercising. Yeah. That's really what they're for. And then after that, you're going to start burning fat. And when you burn fat, something called ketones are released. And if you're in an intermittent fasting, this is the sweet spot that you feel like hitting. Yeah. And if you've ever done like atkins or any other sort of a slow car, we're no car, kind of, uh, eating, then you know all about ketones. They talk a lot about ketones and keto genesis. Uh, you could also refer to it as the metabolic switch. Um, and that's, that's the point where your body switches over and says, okay, I need some energy. And the only place that I can get it here is the fat stores. Uh, and you have entered ketosis at that point. And that's a big part of a low car or no car, die at and a big part of IF. Yeah. And ketones are basically what replaces glucose. Um, when you burn your fat, the ketones are released. And that's what you're running on energy. But the thing is is your body's not set up to run on ketones for very long, which is why intermittent fasting is much safer than fasting fasting because as ketones build up in your blood, it makes your blood acidic, which if so fact, though, can eventually lead to coma and then death. And for people who are diabetic, especially, I think type one diabetic, but I'm pretty sure for all people with diabetes, it's really hard for your body to balance ketones in the first place. So they build that much more quickly than for other people. So that makes it even intermittent fasting very dangerous if you have diabetes. And I don't know if we said this or not, but I mean, it's, it's, it's very smart. If, to number one, find a doctor or some sort of healthcare provider that you, whose opinion you trust and what got to. And then number two, talk to that person about whether or not you specifically should undertake intermittent fasting. Yeah. And if you have diabetes, I'm guessing they're probably going to say, hey, probably shouldn't. Yeah. Um, I have a great GP now that I've had for a number of years now and I finally sort of got to the point where I locked in a GP that has gotten to know me. And it's that, it's that relationship with a doctor, I always wanted where I feel like he likes me and cares about me and like knows me and my, my health to a degree. You know what I mean? Yeah. That's cool. It's, it's really good and worthwhile. I don't, uh, not want to go to them. In fact, I proffably, and he's got a great messaging system, which is awesome because you don't feel like you have to make an appointment for everything. But, uh, I probably bug him too much, and I'm too proactive about health stuff if that's possible. But it's, um, it's really beneficial, you know, like to have a doctor that's invested in you because then you can say, you know, hey, doc, I'm thinking about trying this and they'll, they'll know you and they're not just reading from a script and they'll say, you know, it was probably not a good idea to do that. Or this might work for you. Give it a shot and maybe come see me in three months and we'll do some blood work and check you out. Right. Good stuff. That is great stuff. You're very lucky. You're very fortunate, Chuck. Yeah. I feel like I went many years without having a good GP and didn't go to the doctor a lot because of that. Well, that's the next one reason not to go to the doctor. Like you said, you don't want to go to the doctor and then either the doctor might be making you feel bad about yourself, which is a terrible, terrible thing for a doctor to do. Or if you feel like they're phoning it in and just kind of giving you boilerplate advice, right, that doesn't really make you feel any better either. So yeah, I mean, to find a really good doctor's man, hang on to that guy. Yeah. And he cusses in front of me, which I love. Oh, yeah. And he recognized and complimented my pavement shirt last summer was in. So like he takes all the boxes. Wow. Yeah. He really does. What a dream boat. Yeah. Dr. Ramshaw, I'll shout him out. He's great. So I say we take a little break and we'll come back and talk about what studies say about all this stuff. Let's do it. Hey, everybody.

Going back I think to the sixties is when it really started to kind of get underway, but it really picked up in like the the 2010s. Yeah. And that's when everybody was like, oh this stuff is so great it's amazing and like one study came in and said it's great so now we're all going to try it. Since then things have kind of leveled out a little bit like you said people have if not started to poo poo at least started to look at it with a little more skepticism as you should anything like that. Yeah, great. But if you look at the major meta studies that look at really high quality studies together, it seems like it's backed up that there is something to the especially in realms outside of weight loss. Yeah and what we'll kind of go through those in a sec but Ed did point out that like what you're looking at is calorie restriction in general is what IF accomplishes. It's just sort of in the way that it does it. So calorie restriction is going to improve you know you're going to lose weight if you take in less calories it's kind of a no-brainer. You'll probably end up with better health markers as a result of fewer calories. And a lot of study say like hey this is sort of like any other calorie restriction and that you're going to lose some weight. But IF is easy to follow or I guess I just say easier to follow for some people than calorie counting there's a lot of great apps out there. Lot of great fitness trackers where you can enter the food to eat, enter the drinks you have and stuff like that and all the snacks in your exercise and it'll keep track of all that for you. So it's easier than ever before to do that but it's still really hard for some people like me to do that. I go through periods where I'm really good at entering all that stuff and then I got to the point where I was like I know how to eat I just need to do that. I'm really tired of asking to get up my phone every time I put something in my mouth. So it's not a great fit for me but something like intermittent fasting is just sort of you know if you're doing 16-8 that's all you got to remember and then just eat sensibly. Right. The upside of the whole thing is that the recommendation is eat fewer large meals and scientifically speaking large meal is a thousand calories or more. Some of those down to 600 calories, 700 calories even and you will start to lose weight. Especially if you convert the fried, I think they call it an abesogenic diet. Lots of sugar, lots of fried foods. Or also called the American or standard American diet. If you convert that to healthier stuff and you're knocking some of the calories off, you really will see good results. Especially if you can change your attitude toward food and come to appreciate that then you can make it like a long-term adaptation. The point here is it doesn't matter how you approach that whether like you said counting calories and staying within a certain window every day or just doing it through intermittent fasting. That's a good way to cut out a thousand calorie meal. Just don't eat past a certain time and make sure that that time comes before you typically would eat a thousand calorie meal. Yeah and I guess there's just a lot of first-hand accounts in this one because I've struggled with weight for a lot of my life but for me it's like I had to get to that point that I've only just recently gotten to where it wasn't about denying something that I craved but it was about looking at something that I really loved to eat and been like, oh god, no I can't eat that. You know what I mean? Yeah. Like now when I see a big cheesy cheeseburger in fries, I don't go, oh god, that looks so good, I don't want it so bad but I can't have it. I look at it and I go, my god, it looks like a part of tech on a plate. It's not appealing, it's a little bit appealing but it's not as appealing looking. Yeah and I'm glad you correct yourself because I don't think it is meant to be a switch where you go from, oh my god I want that burger to gross. I'll never eat that again. I'm sure that happens for some people but I don't know that that's realistic for the majority of people instead like a really well crafted burger like that is pretty rare. We talked about this in the fried chicken episode if you just held out for really genuinely good fried chicken and that's the only kind you ate. You would automatically start eating less fried chicken same thing with the cheeseburger, same thing with anything that's unhealthy or bad for you. I'm making scare quotes right now. Yeah. If you just stick to the ones that are worth it, if you set a bar for yourself and say that is not worth it, this is worth it and you indulge in the worth it stuff once in a while, then you're saying that makes the whole thing so much easier. It's just denying yourself time after time after time. No one can keep that up. It's really tough. Yeah it's not even worth trying. It's finding what's moderate for you. Right. And then from that point on you can build like a different relationship with food. I've been through the same stuff as you and I'm actually I'm pretty good at exposure where I'll go through the grocery store. I'll purposely go down aisles that I don't need stuff from that has snacks and treats on it. Just just to be like this isn't worth it. It's not going to look anything like it does on the box. It's not going to taste anything like what the ad is making me think it's going to taste like. It's literally not worth it. I've actually kind of gotten pretty good at that to where everyone's while will be like, no this is actually totally worth this slice of public steak. It's worth it. I'll do that once in a while but certainly not every time and certainly not with any snack I pass in the grocery store. Yeah I just judged a I was a quote and quote celebrity judge. Yeah. The Kirkwood Springflings Wingflings and first of all it was so much fun. I would be a judge in any food contest ever because it's I've never done it before and it was just really fun to sit and taste the food and like to rate it according to the scale. I had a really good time but it was 15 chicken wings. Some of these were the big huge double wings you know with the drum and the the flat and you know the one eight like probably five of them all the way through because they were that good but the others I just like ate a bite or two and tasted but then I looked at the plate at the end and all of those wings and I was just like how did I used to sit down and just scarf through 12 to 15 chicken wings like it was nothing. It's like that's just so much stuff. Yeah and that's just a mental hurdle I guess I finally got over but again you know stiffened for everyone and I'm not saying my problems are solved it's where I am right now you know. Yeah and I wanted to say something for those of you who are into body positivity believe that you know diet culture is very harmful. I totally respect that that's your right. We're not speaking to you. We're not trying to convince you to think otherwise at all at all. This is not for you but there are plenty of listeners out there who are in the same boat that you and I are in Chuck that want to lose weight and have struggled with this for so many years and yeah I guess we're just sharing what's worked for us which may or may not work for you but I just want anybody to think like we're shaming anybody who's not trying to lose weight not at all. Hopefully you know us that well are well enough by now to know we wouldn't do that but I feel like it's worth it's worth pointing out just because it can be such a sensitive subject for people. Yeah understandably so. Yeah I mean I do believe that you can be very healthy at a range of weights I'm talking about I'm for me I don't mean I want to look good in my bikini bottoms. I like have some poor health markers at my age you know it's just inevitable and I want to be around for my daughter and I want to be around to record this dumb show. You'd be so mad if I dropped dead. I would be pretty upset. I would I kick your corpse. You'd like to yeah. Don't mean you just had to eat that last fried chicken cheeseburger didn't you? Put your ashes in a punching bag and add boxing. That's a really great idea. Yeah not for you but I'm saying like if you're a boxer you could definitely do worse with your ashes. Oh I thought you meant like you know did you hate your parents put them in a heavy bag and beat them up for the rest of your life. That works too. Man that's got really dark. All right so let's look at some of these meta studies and what they've revealed because like I said a lot of these have been done on mice and stuff like that there's less research on humans but still a lot. I think it said they were like 300 IF studies last year alone but in 2020 the NIH looked at a bunch of studies the way back several decades and said this hundreds of animal studies and scores of human clinical trials have shown the intermittent fasting can lead to improvements in health conditions such as obesity diabetes cardiovascular disease cancers and neurological disorders. So you know there you go that's a meta study analysis. Yeah by the by the NIH which I mean they typically hopefully don't throw their weight towards something that's illegitimate. Yeah I mean it's so hard to find anybody to trust. Everyone's got such an agenda these days but I mean if you're going to trust somebody it might as well be the NIH. Right so yes they basically said there are other health benefits out there besides just losing weight and that it could conceivably be worth trying. One of the things they pointed out was that when you release key tones it it basically triggers your body to go into a defensive state anti-inflammatory state your immune system kicks in there's all sorts of of things that happen and change in your body when you start burning fat and one of the things that that it does is it starts kicking off your defenses against metabolic stress. I didn't know that was it's not metabolic syndrome where you have like insulin resistance and basically pre-diabetes or maybe diabetes. This is different. This is what happens when you exercise and you start tearing up your muscles that actually triggers your body's defenses to rebuild and repair and build more muscle it's the point of exercising and resistance training and that one of the things that happens with key tones is it actually helps that process go more smoothly of repairing and building muscle. So at least one study is found that if you exercise using IF that it can actually help build muscle that's one study that we turned up but it makes logical sense if that's what key tones do. Yeah I agree other people have come out to just a point out that since intermittent fasting isn't just one thing and there are quite a few different subtypes and ways to go about it that it also can complicate studies because you know some people might qualify five two or 16 eight or the O-mad. O-mad or warrior diet as intermittent fasting so you know first study should be comparing apples to apples. Yeah one other big criticism of the enthusiasm for intermittent fasting is a lot of these studies they leave off like in mice or you know in rats. So like for example there's there's a big talk about converting white fat to brown fat brown fat as much easier to burn and it's how you lose weight basically it's how you burn fat and that intermittent fasting helped turn more white fat to brown fat in mice that's not necessarily something that you see in humans but at least in mice within are met and fasting you this so if you hear like oh yeah helps you burn fat faster ask yourself like wait how and then secondly how how did they figure that out.

You make a 10,62.5 micrograms and a 20,5 micrograms inhalation powder. Asma isn't pretty. You avoid triggers, mist moments, can't catch your breath. It can be a daily struggle. That's right, but breathing should be beautiful. Trilogy is the only once a day triple therapy maintenance treatment for adults with asthma. Just one dose of trilogy can help you breathe easier for a full 24 hours. Results may vary. Trilogy won't replace a rescue inhaler for sudden breathing problems. Trilogy contains a medicine that increases risk of hospitalizations and death from asthma problems when used alone. When this medicine is used with an inhaled corticosteroid like in trilogy, there's not a significant increase risk of these events. Do not take trilogy more than prescribed. Trilogy may increase risk of thrush infections and serious allergic reactions. Get emergency care if you get a rash, hives, mouth and tongue swallowing, or breathing problems. See your doctor if your asthma does not improve or gets worse. For more info, ask your doctor visit trilogy.com or call 1833-873-1333. Because breathing should be beautiful. All right, we're back with some promise bullet points as Ed has them. And you already talked about the brown fat in mice. Don't take the brown fat. That's right. I had never heard of white fat in brown fat. It seems crazy. Brown fat sounds kind of tasty. It seems like fatty gravy is what it seems like. We want the brown fat though. I think brown fat is your body's way of heating your body up, right? Like you're uping your body temperature? Yeah, so this is totally me armchairing this, but from the research putting together different threads of research from this topic. White fat is probably the deep storage of energy and then the process of burning that fat part of that is converting it to brown fat first. That's by guess. Yes. What you do in a cast iron skillet? That's right. You brown some fat. That sounds good. All right, in mice, once again, some of these are inhuman, we'll point that out. But in mice it did show that you had improved metabolism and improved intestinal function with an AF diet. And specifically intestinal stem cell function. And they think that at the stem cell intestinal stem cell level is where disorders like type 2 diabetes, obesity and colon cancer happen. It's from an excess nutrient uptake they think, which releases way more hormones than normal. And thus it leads to all these problems. And so what they were saying in mice, it actually curbed that, which is really helpful. Yeah. And you know, it's reducing inflammation or old friend that we just talked about. Exactly. All right, I guess our old enemy. I said that wrong. What else? All right, this one's in humans. It can lead to a reduced resting heart rate, lower your bad cholesterol, which is the LDL and reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease. That's right. Also reduces fasting blood, glucose and insulin levels so that reduces your diabetes related symptoms. It's in humans. In humans, yeah. Thank you for pointing that out. Sure. What about the next one in mice? Reduction in oxidative brain damage. So what we're talking about is potentially a reduction in symptoms of Alzheimer's. Yeah. And they found something similar in humans, not necessarily a reduction in Alzheimer's symptoms yet, but at least an increasing cognitive performance, which is kind of contradicts what I've experienced where you get brain fog after a while. But what they've kind of traced it to is that it helps mitochondria function in the brain. mitochondria is a little powerhouses of the cells. And that it also aids in neurogenesis. So it's actually helping you're actually developing more neurons than you would if you weren't intermittent fasting is what that study showed. Yeah. I hope you can pronounce this next word. What keto genesis can release? What is that? At a Ponectin? Hmm. Okay. Very nice. What is that? At a Ponectin is a homostatic signal hormone. And basically what it does is it helps regulate glucose levels, helps in lipid metabolism, helps in insulin sensitivity. It helps move insulin into the cells where the insulin's carrying the glucose helps in insulin production. It's basically you want a decent amount of added Ponectin in your in your bloodstream because it's a very helpful balancing act, balancing hormone. All right. So those are some positives. Ed pointed out that there's there are a lot more bullet points he could have included. Did you have any extras you wanted to throw in there? There is another one. It also moderates leptin and leptin is a hunger signaling hormone that we talked about before. But it's produced by adipose, right? So your body's like, oh I've been burning some fat. I'm going to release some leptin and make you feel hungry. So it triggers hunger and food consumption. And if you have two little leptin, you're going to be hungry all the time. Like starving and you're going to overeat even though you don't necessarily need it. If you have too much leptin, your body will actually become desensitized to an leptin resistant. And so it's going to have the same effect as too little leptin. You're going to be hungry all the time and keep putting on weight. So intermittent fasting seems to moderate your leptin levels to a kind of like a goldy locks zone of where you want it. The old goldy locks zone. It's such a great analogy. Here's what he is. Because it means it's just right. Yeah. If you wondered about how it compares to other kind of more recent diets, although Mediterranean isn't recent at all. It's as old as the world is. As old as the bronzy. But, you know, sort of talking about the Mediterranean diet has become sort of trendy lately as well as Paleo. And there have been studies. It was 120, that compared Paleo Mediterranean and IF. And I think in those groups, IF lost the most. 8.8 pounds. Yeah, compared to the other two, everyone lost weight. Mediterranean diet is a great way to eat. And I've never done Paleo, but I've heard good things about that too. But one point that I found in the study is that people on IF and Mediterranean adhere to these diets about 20% more than on the Paleo. And it's just common sense if it's a diet you're doing for health markers or weight loss and you're not sticking to it, then you're not really going to get the real result of what that diet means or how it affects you. Yeah. And you know, I meant to point up at the very beginning of the episode where we were talking about how, you know, like some all diets are fads. The Mediterranean one seems to be the one diet that bucks that trend. Because it's been around steady since the 90s. Easily, I would say even early 90s is when it became popular. Well, as far as labeling it that right. Right. Exactly. But then so so non-meditranian people trying a Mediterranean diet. I think really kicked off in the 90s. And I mean, people are still trying it now. And some people have adopted it and kept it. And I just feel like that's the one that's that's the most doable for people in my opinion. Yeah. Because it's, um, you're not, I mean, you're denying yourself like stuff like fried chicken, but you're just killing you like really good food. I mean, I guess if you cook the fried chicken as a bonus skinless chicken breast in olive oil, that's fried chicken, right? Yeah, but Mediterranean, you're eating good fish. Like, you know, those are some of the the hallmarks of that diet is olive oil and fish and wine don't forget the wine. But wine and nuts and things like that. Like that's all yummy tasty anyway. So it's, uh, it's, I agree. Yep. It's finding good fish is sometimes the problem for if you live in one. Uh, yes, it really, really is. It's sad, but true. Although if you've been to beetle cat and I think in M. Park, her little five. I have been there many, many times. It's one of the places that I like to take out a towngess because it's great fun and lively and delicious and really quickly one of my co-judges at the wing fling was Fort Fry. He was a big, uh, really, big Atlanta restructure and that's one of his places. Yeah. He's a big shot. Yeah. Fort's big, you literally run. He was next to me actually, but he and my brother, old friends, they, their kids played baseball and stuff together. So, uh, Fort's cool. That's right. So you already knew him before you judged with him? I had met him once. Uh, he was very kind original flagged at restaurant. J.C.T. was up and we had a big, mother's day or birthday dinner there with a bunch of my family and he can't the whole meal. It's like 10 of us. Wow. And, uh, that was my first experience with Fort. So just good to do. It's a great first experience. What are you going to say about beetle cat, though? Well, they have like the best giant shrimp you will find in the state of Georgia by far. Maybe even including inland Carolinas. Okay. You know what that means is Fort's got a guy. He has a great guy. And also everyone's from how people email us and be like, hey, I'm coming to Atlanta. Where should I eat? Just look up a Ford fry restaurant and go to it. There's, you will not go wrong. You cannot go wrong at a Ford fry restaurant in that land. That's true. Yeah. You got a great Italian place, great Mexican place, great seafood place. Yep. Uh, he kind of covers all the bases and uh, I would recommend upstairs at Beetlecat unless you're uh, young and like to party downstairs. This is a little rowdy for me. Yeah. Yeah. I like it upstairs. I've only ever been there during the day and it was not rowdy. But it looks downstairs. Yeah. Downstairs. Yeah. Downstairs. You get to a little rowdy in there. I can imagine for for fish restaurant. Yeah. So this is how Ford fry's restaurant's work. I think we were right now. Seriously. You got anything else on intermittent fasting? Oh, I'm late. There is one more thing. Go ahead. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We should talk a little bit about circadian rhythm fasting. It is another subtype of intermittent fasting. And it's almost like the 186. Is it 186? 168. 168. But the the whole key with the uh, and they found really good results and I'll let you kind of put the cherry on top with that result with the mice. But what it really means is doing restricted eating like that. But um, really focus on the morning. So like maybe an 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. is when you're eating, uh, or even 5 p.m. And like literally nothing after that. Yeah. Everyone's in a while. You'll find somebody who's like, no, you need you need to have your biggest meals earlier. I've heard it put his um, eat breakfast like a king lunch like a queen and I can't remember last one, but basically not royalty for dinner dinner like to get who sweeps up the poop in the horse. Exactly. Right. So um, and the point is you're just eating your highest energy food earlier. And um, that's actually tied to circadian rhythms. And one study on time, time, restrictive uh, feedings found that um, mice lived up to 35% longer life spans. If they did circadian timed feedings. And I think they were doing this like, they were probably testing the mice's hormones to determine whether they should be fed right then or not like that level. But you can still do it by what you just said like start eating a little earlier um, restrict your um, food in the evening and then eat the most toward the beginning of the day. That would qualify as circadian timed food. Yes. Or circadian timed feeding. And if you did that, if you're an average person in the United States average lifespan is 77 years, you'd had 27 years on to your life if that worked out for you like it did the mice and that study. Yeah, and we should point out in that study. That was 35% longer for specifically the circadian rhythm model, uh, compared to 10% longer for just regular uh, intermittent restricted feeding. Yeah. Still not thin as knees that. Nothing to, you know, 10% do you really want to live 35% longer? I mean, if it's healthy and you don't care about your loved ones. Sure. Yeah. I'm just for if you make new friends really easily. Yeah. Are you getting anything else? Uh, I got nothing else. I don't either, which means of course everybody's time for a listener mail. All right. I'm going to call this one, uh, a listener from the Czech Republic. Oh, nice. Yeah. This is a good one. Uh, high Josh, check in Jerry. My name is Ota Carr and I live in the Czech Republic. I started listening to the show about two years ago when I started a 40 minute commute and I've never listened to, I had never listened to any podcast before. So I asked Google to give me some options and that's how I found stuff you should know. Thanks, Google. That's right. It was exactly what I needed. Really like the way your podcast is basically a normal conversation between two guys, from the same generation as I am about so many interesting topics. Maybe I wouldn't find some of the topics interesting myself, but because you research the things and talk about them in such a great way, there's always something worth remembering for me. Nice. Thank you. Yeah. It's very nice. Uh, this whole thing is just a very sweet letter. How lovely. Uh, I've always been curious about things and good in remembering random facts that I've heard somewhere. So your show was just the perfect way for me to find out something new that I might want to look a bit more into later. I often wonder if teaching at schools should actually be done by two people having a conversation about a subject. How about that? Pretty cool. I mean, it wasn't that like in that platonic or or stoddling like it's some form of probably. So credit. So credit. So credit. Yeah. So credit. Uh, it is so great. Uh, I guess there's a very little chance that you're going to do a live show in the Czech Republic. It's probably right. But if any of you would whatever travel to Prague, let me know. I can give you some hints about where and when to go see the best of Prague. So thank you very much for what you do. I find the fact that there are people like you who like to explore things and talk about them and such an enthusiastic kind and often funny way, very comforting. Best regards. Ota-car. Man, Ota-car. That is a very sweet, very sweet. And I think you know, thank you very much for presenting that to us. And Prague is definitely on my list. For sure. I've been, but it was a long time ago. Yeah, you need to go back. You were like broke and backpacking. Why aren't you? Yeah. I'm going to go in. Something besides bread. I'm pretty sure it's a different nation now even from the last time you were there. So check it out. It was newly the Czech Republic then. What? What would they call it? The velvet revolution? No, but it was not Czechless. I do not remember that. At least I guess. Okay. Well at any rate, I think we lost Ota-car even by this point. So if you want to get in touch of this like Ota-car, did you can send us an email to stuffpodcast at iheartradio.com. Stuff you should know is a production of iheartradio.
