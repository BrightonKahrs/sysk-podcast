Welcome to Stuff You Should Know. A production of I Heart Radio. Hey and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh and Chuck's here too and Jerry's here too and this is Stuff You Should Know about the history of exercising. I found this super fascinating. Yeah, it is pretty fascinating. I don't know why. It just grabbed me and I guess it grabbed me earlier because it was my idea because I think I don't know. Maybe I'd seen Anchorman and they made the Yawking joke. And then I remembered hearing that exercise is sort of new. If you look at not only the history of humans but the history of America, it's only been around for 50-ish years, 60 maybe. Yeah, I mean in ancient times they were pretty into fitness but then it kind of dropped off for a couple thousand years and we picked it up again in 1960 roughly at the very least the decade of the 60s. And like you said specifically in America in the United States I should say. Yeah, just should we do it? Yeah, the whole thing is that the first half of the 20th century, it's not like there weren't people exercising, right? They were out there. They were just considered weirdos or possibly gay. Exactly. They didn't even really use the word exercise much. It was called physical culture. And like you said it was a really niche thing. They were obviously there were sports and athletes and people like that were doing physical training and the military did stuff like that. Right. And there was body building but that was super niche too. But as far as like your regular average American walking around, they were just walking around or sitting in chairs. They were walking around eating a steak while they walked around. That's what they were doing. With the martini and you did mention you know possibly gay and that was a characteristic early on is like if you are a man and it's 1940 something or 50 something and you want to have like a nice body and you want muscles. People might say well, you're probably gay or you're probably a narcissist because gyms are for gay men to meet each other. And that was just sort of the perception at the time. Exactly. And then women didn't have it much better. They were almost culturally forbidden for exercising. In the first place it was unlady like to engage in exercise or typically consider that. On top of that, exercises you're exercising for yourself. It's kind of the basis of exercise. And that also seemed unseemly for women to engage in such a self-indulgent pursuit. Right? And then on top of that, there was a general idea that your uterus might fall out if you exercise too vigorously. Yeah. Or just you may not be able to get pregnant if you exercise. So just don't do that. Just stay in your feet all day and do the housework. Exactly. Which is what we'll see is actually an example of moderate figures of the collective. That's right. It's better than sitting down. So in about 1960, if you asked American, hey, do you exercise regularly? I'm surprised at this. About a quarter of Americans would have said yes. That seemed high. It does. It seems high to me too. In 1987, less than 30 years later, the answer to that question was yes from almost 70% of people. So in those three decades from 1960 till the 80s through the 80s, exercise came on the scene and just jelled with the world in the United States in particular. Yeah. I would be curious to see that poll and see exactly how it was worded and defined. Right. Because that's 24% seems high. And I could see people just being like, well, sure. I cut the lawn. Right. You know that kind of thing. And regularly was once within the last three years. Hey, cut the lawn once every three years. Right. So again, it wasn't just women who were considered at risk health wise from exercise. Everybody was considered at risk. If you exercise too much, you were probably over taxing your heart and you're probably going to die young. They actually thought athletes were at risk of dying young from overexerting themselves. Yeah. And then it was finally, I think about in the late 40s when a British epidemiologist named Jeremy and Morris. And then in the Morris, mixed with what say, Norris so bad. I'm going to teach you. It's a real, it's a weird combination. But he said, you know what? I like to jog and I like to exercise. And I think that this is wrong. So I'm going to go about studying it in the most clever way possible. Yeah. It's a pretty interesting study. And by the way, Olivia put this together for us. And as usual, I think she crushed it. Knocked it out of the park. I had no notes. Not that we're usually no. No. I mean, no, we're not very naughty. I like to just a gold star. But yeah, he had a really ingenious and sort of contained way to study this. He did lots of other studies. But one of the ways he did it was he said, you know, we got these big double-decker buses in England. Everybody see those. Everyone seen those. And there's there's two people who work on those. There's the guy who drives them. And then there's the guy who is the bus conductor. And he's always huffing it up and down those stairs. And, you know, granted, it's not like 40 stairs or anything. But there's steep in your climb in those things all day long back and forth. Right. So he was like, I got a nice little captive audience of people who are pretty similar probably in lifestyle and in age and stuff like that. And one of them exercises, one of them doesn't. Any found that drivers had prices more than twice as many heart attacks as conductors. He was like, wait a minute. Did some more studying and said, hey, everybody, I think exercising is good for your heart. Yeah. Another people who were like, wait a minute. Let us check it out. Well, what? It's true. Study after study started coming in saying, like, not only does exercise not put you in an early grave. It actually probably prevents you from an early grave. So maybe we should all start exercising. So this was, so in the 50s, this was the era of proving that exercise was good for you. And then by the time the 60s rolled around, people were ready to start getting into it. But at first it seems like they were, they were more hardcore surprisingly enough at first than we are today. Because you look around and like so many people exercise today, especially in comparison to like the 60s and 70s at the beginning of the boom. But people have just kind of mellowed out a little bit before it was just like as intense as you could, you could possibly get in every single way. Well, I mean, these are the people that drank three more genius at lunch. Yeah. That's not one hardcore, right? Yeah. You're just going to do something you're going to do at heart. Right. So in fact, we were talking about those people because the culture of work really changed since about the mid-19th century when people moved away. Not entirely obviously we still had farmers and stuff. But, you know, mainstream America moved away from hard labor jobs into desk jobs. And they started to worry that the, the sedentary lifestyle wasn't good for them. And the mid-70s is when corporate America started tuning in because Fortune magazine wrote an article that basically said, hey, all these CEOs and board members that we have, or just a bunch of, and this is of course in the mid-70s. There are a bunch of old sort of overweight white fat cats. And they're all having heart attacks and it's costing our firms and corporations about 700 million bucks a year. And this is mid-70s numbers. And so it was them who started the health boom. It was sort of like corporate CEOs. I think in the 60s and 70s, Olivia found some research that found that generally like the people that started this whole thing were college educated. They had some money and they were generally white people. Yeah, that's who, that's who kicked off the boom. Today the differential in race is pretty much a race. But there's a still a gap in education where if you have college or some college or a bachelor's degree, you're, you're about twice as likely to exercise on an average day as somebody who just has a degree from high school. Really interesting. It is interesting. Another thing that happened to not just the health aspect, but in the 20th century because of that increasing sedentaryness. And Americans became a lot more fixated on how you looked physically, especially white, whether you were overweight or not. And there became a much greater emphasis on not being overweight. And that really dovetailed with the idea of taking care of your insides, while also taking care of your outsides. And that really kind of provided the foundation for kind of funneling people into the exercise boom of the 60s and 70s. You could live longer. You could look better. So just go exercise. Let's all give it a try. Yeah, for sure. And into the 80s is when you really saw a boom and women exercising more and more. The whole fitness movement was was almost geared toward women at that point. For a number of reasons, one was women trying to become more empowered, women gaining power and empowerment. The feminist movement that said, all right, if you're going to do that in the workplace, why not be strong in your personal life physically strong? Strong like bull. Yeah, exactly. And so be strong in your work life, be strong in your physical life, title nine, of course. Really help things out because all of a sudden girls sports were getting more funding and more attention. And then like you said, the standards for physical attractiveness changing was for men and women and everyone across the gender spectrum. Exactly. So the first thing that really caught everybody's attention was jogging. That was the one that really laid the groundwork and jogging grew out of legitimate running. Like it came, most people pay New Zealand Olympic track coach name, Arthur Liddeard as the guy who, if he wasn't interested or involved in bringing jogging to the masses, he still was kind of like the inadvertent father of the whole thing. In the 60s, he came up with training techniques for marathon runners that people still use today. It's really simple, really basic, but it's really effective. It's things like on a Monday you run 10 miles at half effort over hills and roads and then Tuesday you do, you know, flat 15 mile run or something like that. I don't think that's exactly it. But people use it today. And the fact that there was now a framework that anybody could just buy this book or buy this pamphlet in approach jogging. That really kind of helped us your people in. But again, bear in mind, this is a Olympic level track coach who's establishing this stuff. And this was people's first entrée into jogging. So the earliest joggers were hard core like scary. I'm a little nervous about them and we're talking about people who are running around in the 60s and 70s. Yeah, I think they, I think they like to be called runners those types. Sure. They're like, you're a jogger, Chuck. Actually I'm not even that speedwalker. Like Chris Paul, I should do speedwalking. To me, I'm sorry, speedwalking is way harder than jogging. Oh, do you mean like on your cardio or just your body or yeah, full cardio. Yes. Intent. Okay. Well put. So in the mid 1960s, a guy you may have heard of named Bill Bowerman. He was a running coach from the University of Oregon. Go ducks. And co-founder of a little company called Nike. He published a pamphlet kind of based on stuff Arthur Liddyer to have been talking about. And then eventually wrote this book that I remember seeing on houses of like friends of mine. For sure. It was, it was a very big book. It was called jogging. Colen, even back then, a physical fitness program for all ages. He co-wrote it with a cardiologist named W. E. Harris. Talks about all the health benefits of running. And it really caught on. It's really funny though. Like people still, like it caught on, but it was still sort of a new thing. So the New York Times wrote an article that demonstrated. This was in April of 1968 that like when people were running like cops occasionally. It did. Real stories like a cop would stop and say like, why are you running? What are you running from? Or what did you do? Or people that were runners and joggers said, you know, I like to run at night because people don't stare at me. I don't feel as weird. So it's just so funny to look back at, you know, and this was in the late 60s that people jogging on the streets for you. Like, what's up in that person? Where are they running? Right. And at night they like to run in all black with a black watch cap and black mask covering their eyes. Yes. Very safe. There was another guy who really brought jogging to the masses. His name was Jim Fix. He wrote the complete book of running released in 1977. And he threw us up to the author for running if there ever was one. It was him. To your fix. Yeah. And he ironically died while jogging. He ran himself to death. He had a heart of mass of heart attack while jogging. But he still, I mean, it doesn't really undo what he did, which was, hey, everybody, let's go jog. And that's what anchor man was referring to. Right. The jogging trend that Jim Fix helped usher in in the late 70s. Well, there was another Jim in the 70s, a man by the name of President Jim Carter. It'd be weird. It's on so weird. It does sound weird. He's such a Jimmy. He totally is. Jim seems like he'd have an overly strong handshake. Right. Jim Carter. Jim Carter. Good to meet you. Yeah. What did you mean, Carter? He liked me lately. He high five. But this was at a time in the 70s when the President of the United States had influence on popular culture. Like, I don't feel like the President's really have that much anymore. No. No. It's dying fast at least. And he was a jogger from the White House. This is the late 70s. He would jog sometimes 10, 12 miles at a time. Really got into it. And the New York Times wrote about this, of course. And, you know, if someone's in the White House jogging and running, then that normalizes it for a lot of America. Yeah. I read an article about that. I don't know if it was the New York Times winner not, but he, yeah, it wasn't New York Times. It chronicled him going on this run. Like he held like a fun run basically at Camp David. And he almost collapsed on one of the hills and had to be ushered off and taken to the hospital. Oh, really? Yeah. And he was like running with, you know, dozens of scores, if not hundreds of other people on this fun run. And they were running with the President. And he had secret service guys running with them, keeping pace. But he, he had to leave the race that he helped organize because he just went to the United States. He just went too hard. That was, that was how they used to do it. Did they say, over a bullhorn now dropping out and running with 32 Jim Carter? Shame. Shame. It's how they used to do it. Would you, oh, was that John Connery? No, I didn't mean it, but sure. I'll take that. Yeah, that was Sean Connery. Shaming Jimmy Carter on that run in the late 70s. It sounded like Sean, you doing Sean Connery saying same. That's how they heard in my, Yeah, shame. Yes. Shame, throwback. So speaking the New York Times and I guess we'll take a break after this. But in the late 90s, 97, they wrote a article kind of looking back on running in jogging. And they were keen to point out that like even into the 70s though, it was still a bit of a subculture. Like you said, they were like running in jogging enthusiast, wasn't like tons of mainstream Americans were running. It was still like, what are those people doing? Like should I do that? Right. Alright. Okay. Right time. I think it is break time. Alright. We'll be right back with a Robx. Hi, I'm Kristen Bell. Getting help from my anxiety made me feel like myself again. But we have all sorts of reasons for putting off taking care of ourselves. I thought I could just keep pushing through my depression symptoms. Let's push through dinner with the in-laws, not life.

This was the one that was like probably the most popular thing of the 80s. If you ask me, I think a robix dominated the 80s jogging the 70s. And a robix was around a lot longer than just the 80s. It was one of those things where some people who were kind of into exercising, kind of developed it on their own separately. And then just took a little while to get more and more popular as word of mouth spread. But there's a guy named Kenneth Cooper who started it all again in the 60s. He was a US Air Force surgeon. And he was like, you know, those weightlifting, the calcetics that the military uses for training. It's all well and good, but these guys are like dying on these runs and jogs and hikes. They've got no aerobic stamina. Stamina. Exactly. So he started looking into it and he was like, I think we need to start using what we call now cardio. But check then it was a aerobic exercise. Yeah, he was a jogger. He said I think a robix is being sold short. So he wrote a book in 1968 called a robix. And he said, you know, running and walking and biking is what people should be doing. And that's that was his idea of a robix at the time was just getting got heart rate up, sustaining it for an extended period of time. He had a pretty clever test where he could basically tell you in about 12 minutes, what kind of like how could a shape you were in. But then what happened was really, really awesome. Like I really love this section because my mom figures into this, which I'll get to as we go. But women in the United States said, you know what? They're talking about running and biking and walking, but what they're really talking about is getting your heart rate up for an extended period of time. So I'm going to make that my own. And there was one woman in particular very early on. There were some real trailblazers here. She was a dance teacher. Also an Air Force wife. No coincidence by the name of Jackie Sourenson. She read that book. She took that fitness test and found out she was in really good shape. And she was like, but wait a minute, I don't run. How can I be in this good shape? She was like, I'm a dancer. I'm getting my heart rate up. And so she in 1969 came up with a dance based exercise class on the Air Force base in Puerto Rico where they were stationed. And the Air Force said we should produce this as a TV show. So it's just really weird. And they did. It was called a roevic dancing. And eventually she published a book as well in the late 70s. But she I think was one of the first ones. It really was like, you don't have to run. You can be in a room and do this as long as you get that heart rate up. Exactly. And also it just is much more engaging and fun and communal too. You know, biking and jogging. Those are very frequently solitary pursuits. The roevic was a bunch of people getting together in a room and having fun together to popular music, right? Yeah. Clamping and yelling and doing all that stuff. Exactly. And encouraging one another. So this was a really attractive to women at the time. Because this was, you know, they were still coming out of this social expectation that they shouldn't really be exercising. And now they were saying, you know, to heck with you guys, we're going to do this anyway. And this was almost like there was strength in numbers. But there was also there was a social component to it as well. Yeah. There was another woman named Judy Shepherd. She started out in the sixties as well. But she became the founder of Jazzercise. Right. And my mom used to jazzercise. I remember she even had a poster of Judy Shepherd doing different moves to go. Yeah. They came with her record. Like record vinyl record. I should say. Oh, yeah. So my mom would do jazzercise at home. She went to jazzercise class. She was into it for sure. It was originally called Jazz and Dance for Fund and Fitness. Jazzercise is way more marketable. And this to me, maybe the fact of the podcast. It was a Jazzercise that we, you know, was a copy written or whatever, an owned title. Right. I hope by Judy Shepherd. Yeah. I didn't look that out. But it ended up being a franchise. And in 1984, Jazzercise was the second biggest franchise company in the United States behind Domino's beat. That's really something because that was at the time when Domino's was like, We're going to get your pizza in 30 minutes or less or it's free. So everybody was in the Domino's at the time. It's right before the noise. I think right. Like two years before the noise. So Judy Shepherd created what's known as the boutique fitness franchise model, where it was a specific kind of exercise. Usually some sort of branded exercise like Jazzercise that you could go set up in a strip mall for a minimal initial outpour. And people would come flock to your Jazzercise studio. And you still see that today in certain places like bar has a lot of like franchises, different kinds of franchises, curves, which we'll talk about later. That's a franchise. But Judy Shepherd started that with Jazzercise. Yeah. Very big deal. Then those were one of the named Guilda Marx married into the Marx Brothers family. Had taken when you're growing up, apparently was a dancer and even worked out with weights, which was very unusual at the time. Yes. Because that would have been in, I guess, the 30s and 40s. And in 1960 or thereabouts, she was choreographing a show, a charity show in Los Angeles, created an exercise routine. So all the dancers could get in better shape. And everyone loved it. Everyone's like, this is awesome. And she said, wait a minute. I'm onto something here. So she, in her backyard, started a robux classes, then rendered studios. And then eventually, and it became a very big. And as you'll see, sort of when something becomes like a big Hollywood thing and celebrities do it, it becomes a popular thing everywhere, of course. And it was, yes, that's surprising. And it was called Body by Guilda. And it was not only a big deal because body by Guilda was a big deal, but it was a big deal, because she ended up having two clients by the name of Jane Fonda and Richard Simmons. Yes. So Guilda marks essentially created the popularity of a robux. Like, Jazz is there? Yes, it was very popular. Like a robux dancing. That was very popular too. But it was like celebrities like Jane Fonda and Richard Simmons, who became a celebrity just for being into exercise. That really, really increased it in popularity. And Jane Fonda just straight up ripped off Guilda marks. She took a couple of her classes at a body by Guilda in Century City. And the next year, she set up her own studio. I think a couple years later, she published Jane Fonda's workout book, which became an extremely popular bestseller. It was number one on the non-fiction list and stayed there for six months, by the way. She's two million books. That's amazing. We're almost there. We're getting there with our book. Right. We're annoying away at her record. She also released a VHS tape that was wildly popular too. And that's why I mean, people of a certain age today still associate Jane Fonda with exercise and aerobics. And then the people of a certain age parent associate her with funneling money to the vehicle. Right. Still dear. For sure. Yeah, they're still mad about it. Oh, yes, still mad. Here's another stat for you. The Jane Fonda workout tape was the first non-movie VHS tape to top the sales chart. And it was number one as far as VHS sales go for six years. And the whole run of them, she ended up making follow-up tapes. But the whole collected Jane Fonda workout tape set has sold. I'm sorry, between 82 and 95, sold 17 million. Wow. Wow. That's, I mean, numbers like that are amazing. She'd be, I don't even know what that translates to in record sales. But it's what was the biggest platinum seller double platinum? Planoms a million. Oh, really? What's the best? Planoms? Or what's the highest? I think they just keep going triple platinum. Quadruple platinum. So she was 17 platinum. Yeah. That is extraordinarily impressive. And that really does put it into perspective because not a lot of records go platinum. Especially not just like pink Floyd times over. Yeah, exactly. Although I will say she didn't have that much competition back then. The only other two movies on VHS were Beverly Hills Cop and the Empire Strikes Back. Very nice. So the other person that was a body by Gilda graduate after just one class it turned out. Yeah. Sort of. One of the greatest people ever to run around planet Earth. Richard Simmons. The great. And he. If you're not familiar with Richard Simmons or if you just know him from finding Richard Simmons podcast. Even if you're just tangentially familiar with him from you know living through the era where he was on TV everywhere all the time. Go check out Richard Simmons testimony before Congress. Yeah. He's been has a clip of it where he went and testified before Congress. I think of the 90s maybe. Early 90s I think. And he gives. It's Richard Simmons in a suit and tie. So just that is worth going to see. Yeah. It's bizarre to see. But then he opens his mouth and it's just the same old Richard Simmons. And he gives us. Impassioned speech that like we'll kind of make it tear up a little bit and give you chills. And then he also had some laughs in there. He's just great. Just a great person. And this guy everyone at the time thought it was just totally weird. No one ever thought Richard Simmons was like he was never normal. Right. And he was so himself that he just sucked people into his orbit. And he became like a really, really popular star. I would guess one of the most famous people in the world for a brief period in the early 80s. Absolutely. Like you said, he got kicked out of body by Gilda and the one class that he went to by being Richard Simmons basically. And then eventually founded a business. It was a an exercise studio slash salad bar. I get what he's trying to do there. It was called roughage and anatomy asylum. And then eventually he was like, you know, it was dropped a salad bar. Let's just make it a fitness center. Then obviously had the Richard Simmons show in 1980. Started putting out those VHS tapes in 83. And then in the late 80s, it's all leading to this moment. He puts out, sweating to the oldies, which I believe to date has grossed over 200 million out. Amazing. It became the best selling home fitness video ever. Not Jane Fonda. Yes. The top of the heap. Take that pink Floyd. Yeah. And don't forget Dila Meal. Remember that was wildly successful too. Oh, that's right. That was it. It was like some color coded cards. And you could put different color coded cards together in your little Dila Meal portfolio. And that would be your meal for the day. And if you followed these the instructions, you would be able to lose weight. And he was really into losing weight because he had been very overweight as a child. And he was dedicated to making sure that other people didn't suffer the way that he suffered. Yeah. And he was very much dedicated. Very sweet. He wasn't a, it wasn't a phony, I guess. No. He was true to himself. He wanted to have fun while he worked out. I, I loved the guy I know you do too. He's just, he's just one of the great humans. Yeah. He was also a letterman a lot too. Like frequently. It's a great effect for sure. Because he had a sense of humor about himself. He wasn't like, I'm aware of what people, how people looked at him. He just didn't care. And they both played their part. I think Letterman, he wasn't, I don't think, Honestly, don't think Letterman was, is genuinely freaked out and turned off by Richard Simmons in real life. I think it was all just a bit. And he's great. And you know, I didn't follow the, I didn't listen to finding Richard Simmons, but I did sort of follow the story a little bit. And like my big takeaway was, and I know they may have met well because they thought he was being held against his will. But I love that the end result was like, Richard Simmons is fine. Leave him alone. He doesn't want to be bothered to anymore. Just let him, let him live his life. Yeah. You know? Yeah. So winding down the talk of a robix is when I want to talk about my mom for a minute because Olivia points out that, you know, it was marketed to women as a way to like get in shape and lose weight, but also to empower yourself. And to have some time with other women. And my mom was like, and sounds like your mom to a certain degree, but my mom specifically was sort of ideally. And in all the wrong ways situated to really get into this because she was, it was in the 80s. She was in a very unhappy marriage without getting into a lot of specifics. It was not, it was, it was not a good scene in my house. And my parents didn't like each other much. My dad wasn't as supportive, good guy. And my mom dove into aerobics at the American fitness center. I had never seen anyone dive into something before. Did she become an instructor? She became an instructor. She later became a spinning instructor into her 70s. I think at least late six years. Yes. And my dad was, and I didn't really realize this at the time, but this is all what was sort of just coming into my eyeballs and my earholes as a kid. He was not supportive of it. He was threatened by it. He was a, by wish I could cuss. He was a real jerk about it. It's just interesting to look back. It like there were a lot of women like my mom, I think, in the 80s. Yeah, I could see him like talking her down about it and her just being like, I can't hear you. I'm empowering myself right now. Did your mom do this? Like, would she just sit around while the TV was on and do like, like, listen stuff? Yes, she was in it all sorts of stuff like that. Like, just read any like, made for TV, not made for TV. As seen on TV, like exercise item, we probably had. The thigh master. Oh, sure. And that one thing, it was like kind of a weird metal cradle that helped you do sit up and crunches better. You just kind of rocked back and forth on. We had one of those with the mini trampolines. We had all that. Oh, remember, it was called to something rocker, I think actually. I do remember. Probably. You had to have been. If not, that was a mess. Yeah. But just to cherry on top this with my mom, I think not only was it empowering for her, but I think it was also. I think she was totally sticking it to my dad at the same time. Awesome. I don't think my mom was trying to stick it to my dad, but yeah, she sure liked aerobics. Yeah, I'm sure it was empowering for her too. Definitely. Yeah. All right. So second break. Second break. Starting now. Hi, I'm Kristen Bell.

They in Germany, I think, in the 1800s, us all. They got really into gyms for a while and exercising. But it was very spotty and obviously not a very big thing at all. Culturally in the world for the most part. But gyms were known, you know, like YMCA's in the 60s and 70s were around. They were kind of not great. They kind of were stinky like any gym back then. Just wasn't like an awesome place to go. Like you didn't feel great walking into one usually. But in 1939, a couple of gyms open that were, They really changed the game. This is 1939. Jack Lillane, health guru legend opened. What's looked at is the very first health club in the United States in Oakland, California in that same year. I got an in the gym in Santa Monica in your muscle beach, both in 1939. Yeah. Jack Lillane became kind of like that generations. Well, I was going to say Charles Atlas, but they kind of overlap the same time. He, I saw him on a 1980 something episode of the Richard Simmons show as like a special guest. But he was like a big prostlitizer and he told everybody to go work out because they're getting Pudgy, that kind of stuff. Rick Hany, he went a different way. He, from what I can tell established the health club, which was huge in the 70s and 80s. Health club tour, where it was a place where you could go. Not just work out with weights or whatever, but they might have a pool. They probably had a record ball, a few of them. They might have apparently some Vic Tany clubs had ice skating rinks. It was like you would go and you could spend hours there. And they were really nice. But Vic Tany's whole model, I guess he overspent because they went out of business, I think, in the 60s. But they were so, so beloved that other owners, local owners, and sometimes regional owners would just start buying them up and just turn them into something else, which is still a model that gets followed today. Like if you'd like to go to a gym that has a whirlpool at a sauna and a steam room, and like you said a racket ball court, like you can think Vic Tany for that. He was the guy that came up with this sort of all encompassing, really, like something for everyone and also a place that you want to go to that's not smelly and gross. Right. I mean, they're always a little bit smelly if I'm being caught up with. It depends. We used to go to one called Urban Activine. It did not smell and Urban Activine at all. It sold out to LA fitness and it began to smell. Yeah, it was very disappointing. Man, I'm telling you the men sauna totally fine. And then within weeks it was like this smells like button here. I can't even sit in here for 10 minutes. Did the rules change or the cleaning methods? Like what you had to have been the cleaning methods. It's the only explanation. Did everyone nevermind? Yeah, I don't know because I don't think the client had the client held change that quickly. You know, if you put these members to get transferred over, it's just I think they stop cleaning the butts smell out of the sontas. Which is what you want to do if you have a public sauna, okay? So now the health club is established in the sort of mid early to mid 1960s. Like you said, people jumped in there when Vick Tannies chain went out of business. Some were mom and pops. Sometimes companies would come in to start their own new jam and buy up a bunch of them. Notalists was one of those. It bought up a bunch of Vick Tannies. Yeah, closed stores or whatever you call them fitness centers stores. And notals was a big deal because it's like hey, and like if free weights can be intimidating for some people. And like at novelists you can just change a setting and it's a big machine and it's the same as free weights. I don't really know if it's the actual same or not, but they marketed it as like you're still lifting weights. No, it's true. You definitely are and it allowed people a lot more entry into it. Like today, like you go into a gym, there's so many machines there. That's directly from Arthur Jones and his notalists machines that he he started creating by hand, basically it was like a Kellogg brother. Oh, wow. I like this things. Yeah, for sure. His whole thing was you, you can also exercise, get a full exercise or full workout in much shorter amount of time than you could with weights. Right. Right. He basically emphasized working out until you just you had temporary muscle failure. And then you knew you were done with your workout for the day. Right. Seriously. That's what he encouraged muscle failure. Yeah. So by the 70s when these clubs are opening up, there were there were a couple of different models. One was sort of the country club style that was was probably country club and also had like rackets sports and all that other stuff. World pole and steam room. And then there was the ones like that my mom went to and probably your mom went to that was probably in a shopping center. Some of those could be really good. And some of them were pretty credit like anything else if it's just sort of not some huge chain, you know, some are going to be awesome. Yeah, my family went belong to several different rackets clubs in Toledo. And the reason why so many is because we had a long string of getting like your multi year membership. So we've never seen that whole city of Christian and so many of them were in Europe. We had some of their assumptions from the entrepreneurship said a racket club and then within a few months that would just go under. So we move under the next racket club and they take a lot of our money too. I think we did this at least three times that I was aware of when I was a kid. But we always had a racket club membership somewhere I fully thought you're going to say. So I think one of the gyms that people associate with gyms in general is gold gym. And even still to this day that's like if you want serious training and you're going to like you're not messing around you're not there to meet anybody except maybe a mentor who's going to teach you how to get even more buff that's where you go as a gold gym. For sure. That will start by a bodybuilder named Joe Gold. And yeah, you're totally right. I mean, since the sixties it has that rap is like a sort of serious weight lifters gym. Bally total, valley total fitness which if I'm not mistaken, there may still be some independent American fitness centers, but the ones that we belong to, I believe Bally bought them out and took them over if I'm not mistaken. Well, Bally's gone now. I saw a 2015 article that were five left in the world. Oh, really? Well, this is an interesting thing. Oh, okay, got to got to. Yeah, they were doing it. It was during the boom. And that was founded by a former employee of Vick Tanny named Donahue Wildman. And like you said, it was was huge and then sort of gave way to other places like Ellie Fitness in 24 hours. Yeah, and that whole reputation of gyms and health clubs being impossible to cancel your membership and taking advantage of you. That model was dated by Bally total fitness. They were the ones. Like they would, you signed up for a three-year contract, but they didn't tell you that when you were signing up, like business tactics like that. I read a story about a woman who signed up for a lifetime contract in 1987. Payed $53, I think, a year. And was still getting billed after Bally total fitness went bankrupt. Like that's how much of a shady they were. They could still bill you even though they weren't around any longer. Yeah, it was the cell phone contract of the time. Exactly. Exactly. But that came from Bally total fitness. 24 hour fitness actually went a different way. My name Mark Massdrov was the first one to institute monthly membership rather than the standard annual ones. Great idea. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, people loved it. And they got that name after Massdrov realized it was originally 6 a.m. to 11. But he was like, people are out here waiting for this place to open. They don't want to leave at the end of the night. So screw it. I'm taking the locks off the door. Exactly. Let yourselves in. Have a great time. What else? And curves. That is a huge thing. There were women, um, centric or women only fitness clubs, like as early as the 1960s. But curves is the first one that was really like, um, you know what? If you're over 45 and you're a woman and you don't want to go to the gym to get hit on by these gross guys and get gauked at or laughed at or whatever, come to curves. We got a program for you. Started by husband and wife team, Gary and Diane. Uh, heaven with an eye. And I believe at one point, or maybe still it's the largest fitness franchise in the world. Uh, they had like 100,000 different, um, 100,000 locations. 10,000. Oh, was it okay still? Yeah, but that's still a lot. Yeah, that was mid to 1000. And again, it was all over the world. So it was pretty cool. Also, by the way, I, to my, to myself pronounced their last name, even, but I like your interpretation much more. Hopefully. Yeah. Okay. So Chuck, um, there's still plenty of fitness clubs around. Um, I think LA fitness is the leader with more than two billion in revenue a year. Yeah. Hot. Um, but one of the things that really kind of happened, starting in the 90s was that, um, the, the kind of fitness craze just spread out. And there was jogging, aerobics and maybe going to the gym and then health clubs kind of started. And then finally, people like we've done all this for a decade. And there's so now we need some other stuff. So in a few cases, they actually went back to the future and grabbed some established, um, means of working out or exercising and revamped it for the, for the new millennium. Yeah. Yoga was certainly one of those. Um, I just started yoga two weeks ago, by the way, for the first time in the last month or so, it's kind of gotten under my skin. It's really awesome, isn't it? Yeah. And it's, it's kicking my butt, too. And I didn't underestimate. I wasn't like, oh, you're just stretching and you're on the floor and doing stuff like posing and stuff. It wasn't like I thought it was going to be easy, but it's kicking my butt. And I'm like more sore than I've been doing almost anything else. It's awesome. You also gained strength very quickly though, like surprisingly quickly. And balancing yoga is a great thing to, to pick up at any time, but especially like, you know, in your 50s because balance and core strength and all that stuff as you age is really super important for sure. And fun. It's always important. Yeah. Well, yeah, flexibility. But yoga started, uh, you know, in the 19th century and then the 60s and then 70s are a couple of really big PBS shows that grabbed the attention of a lot of people. And it's just always been pretty popular and has never been more popular than it is now. Yeah. The 19th century is when it first was introduced to the United States. I think. Oh, is it like an ancient practice, probably? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It goes way back. Way back. I think that's what I meant. Um, and those were my 100,000 came from that I was confused about curves. There's at least 100,000 yoga studios in the United States alone. And one thing that's cool about yoga in particular is there are some franchises, which is fine. But most yoga studios are independently owned. They're just somebody who loves yoga so much. They opened up their own studio and you can come to yoga there. Yeah. And that's kind of the same with our next, um, not bad because it's been around for a while. But Pilates is kind of similar and that people will lot of mom and pot Pilates places, like for instance, my, um, the person I dated in New Jersey, um, she ended up after I left and we broke up and stuff. She moved to Savannah, Georgia from New Jersey and started up her own Pilates studio. And this wasn't something that she did at all when I was there. So it's definitely something I think that like yoga, people can get into it. And really get into it such that either I want to be an instructor or I want to open up my own business around it. Sure. And Pilates is named after Joseph Pilates. I think you said that didn't say that. Okay. So it is named after Joseph Pilates. He was a German circus performer and his circus happened to be in the UK when World War One broke out and they said, Oh, you're German. We're going to lock you up for four years while the war goes on. So he and his, his whole troop spent, um, World War One locked up in the UK. And while he was there, he sort of developing a exercise regimen based on stretching that apparently saw cats chasing mice and birds around the prison. And so he came up with these exercises that imitated that. And he claimed that that when the 1918 flu epidemic came to the island that he was imprisoned on, not one person who followed his exercise regimen got sick from it. Whether that's true or not, it's a pretty great story. And then one other great story about him is that he smoked 15 cigars and drank a leader of booze every day. What a guy. And he was like one of the gurus of fitness, from, I mean, we're talking back in the teens in 1920s. Yeah, that's amazing. Uh, I should probably plug Carol Studio. Oh, yeah. It's a momentum Pilates Studio in Savannah. And I haven't been in touch with her since then. So go to go to momentum and tell them tell her Chuck sent you and she'll, I'm sure she'll say like, oh yeah, whatever. I haven't in that guy. Nice. Very nice. And the people who come will say, oh, let us tell you. Yeah, do you be like a pod? What? So bars another one. They're definitely worth mentioning because it incorporates elements of ballet, yoga Pilates. And it's named after the bar that, that, basically the handrail that runs across the length of a wall that ballerina is frequently used. But it was created by a German ballerina in the 40s or 50s, no, the 50s, who fled to England. She was, her name was Lottie Burke and she was a free love advocate. And so when she, when she established bar in the bar exercises, she also coupled it with not only is this going to make you feel great, it's going to help your sex life. And that was an overt message of kicking bar from this through the 60s and the 70s. I would have pronounced that by the way, Lotta. Well, unlucky for you, I said it first. You give her a very like Wisconsiny. Lottie. Ring to it. Lottie. Come here, Lottie. Lottie Burke. Boot camp workouts became very popular in the 90s. Obviously took on that sort of military style training where you didn't need a lot of stuff, you just needed to meet a bunch of strangers in a city park and have someone yell at you for an hour? For sure. What about Tybo? Tybo was created by Billy Blanks, who was legit. He was the US karate team captain for US karate and the US Olympic karate team. So he was, I mean, he knew what he was doing and he created Tybo, which kind of incorporated kickboxing aerobics. If you've ever seen, if you were alive, I guess in probably the 90s, you saw the Billy Blanks Tybo info. He managed to sell a ton of tapes from that info martial. It was a very successful info martial. I'm not sure how much Tybo has done still today, but I looked it up to see if it was, you know, is it legit? It definitely is a legit workout. Oh, sure. It's a butt kicker. I tried it once and I was like, I can't do this. Yeah. And another example of one of those that really caught on in Hollywood and LA. And so it had a short, short-ish life. I'm sure people still do it, but the Big Tybo craze was a few years. For sure. What about high-intensity interval training, HITT? Hit. I know this as Tabata, because I was singing trainer for a while and we did, she put me through Tabata, basically every time. And that was named after Sport Scientist named Izumi Tabata, who in the mid-90s was working with Olympic speed skating coaches to create what was a form of high-intensity interval training. Right. Where you do something like push-ups or burpees or mountain climbers or something like that for maybe 20 seconds, rest for 10 seconds, and then you're immediately off into the next exercise for 20 seconds. And sometimes after four minutes, you might get a minute of rest. It depends on how long the Tabata workout is. Like a 12 minute one, you would not get any rest in between certainly not a minute, I should say. But the point is you're getting a high-intensity workout in a very short amount of time. So you're doing like a 12 to 20 minute workout and you're getting the same impact that you would have gotten from say like a 30 to 40 minute workout of lower intensity. But still not low intensity, I mean moderate intensity training. This is just super duper intensity, high intensity training. Tabata definitely established that. Yeah, it's great if you're short on time. Obviously, I think our workouts were 30 minutes and you know, if they were great, I enjoyed it, they were butt kickers, but I liked it. Yeah, I should say speaking of Tabata Japanese guy, you reminded me that, like exercise is really, really big in Japan. So much so that people have or definitely had loud speakers in their house and like in their local community or maybe even their region every morning, they would be like, good morning, it's time to do exercises and everybody would do the same exercises in their house to the voice over the loudspeakers called radio tiso. Interesting. And they also did like corporate calisthenics and stuff, right? Yeah, they were just into like collective exercise for a long time. That's great. And then the last couple will talk about our Zumba and CrossFit. Zumba, very popular, still popular. Apparently it was created by accident in the mid 90s by Alberto Beto Perez. And he was a 16 year old aerobics teacher in Colombia. Apparently as a story goes at least, forgot the usual music and said, I'll just play the music that I have and it turned into sort of a fun Latin dance exercise class. Yeah. And just took off like a rocket. I think he was on the cover of Ink magazine. Once, I mean, like he just, like it was just crazy how much it took off and it's still huge. Zumba is still very much popular a couple decades later. And then CrossFit is wildly popular too, not among everybody, but the people that it's popular with, it's wildly popular so much so that it's commonly referred to. It's like a cult or something like that because people love talking about CrossFit and proselytizing for it. But the point of CrossFit is kind of like what Arthur Jones, the Nautilus creator was talking about, where you work out until you are like just short of injuring yourself essentially. Where you feel like you want to throw up and like you can't do any more. And it combines weightlifting gymnastics a bunch of different stuff, but it's a really, really intense workout that you really have to work your way up to. You shouldn't just jump into a CrossFit class. And if you go to a good CrossFit box, what the studios are called, they're not going to just let you jump into it. Right. Because you can really hurt yourself. Yeah, CrossFit doesn't interest me. No, me either. We've done it before and it's not fun. Yeah. So making yoga though, Emily and I are doing it together. Yeah. And if you like CrossFit, hey, man, we're not yucking your new home. Oh, of course. Our own personal experience who settled out. No, I don't want to work out until I throw up. That's me. Yeah. For sure. This is a good one. It was a good one. I hope we inspired you to do some exercise because it's good for you. I don't care what anybody says. It's good for you. And even if it's not good for weight loss, which we found over the years, definitely not, it's good for mental health. I think we said plenty of times. So just that alone makes it worthwhile. Very worthwhile. If you want to know more about exercising, then just start. It's really easy these days. And since I said that, it's time for listener mail. I'm going to call this Coliseum follow up. Hey, guys, quick note about the, how do we pronounce it? Hippojima or hyphogym? I don't remember. I think I called it a hypojim. Hippojim? All right. Quick note about the hypojim and the Machinable Battles that were reportedly held inside the Coliseum. As you noted, the hypojim was created after the amphitheater was built. The flooding of the floor of the Coliseum only happened in the first decade of the structure. And before the hypojim, hypojim, sorry, was dug and created. Once the hypojim was constructed, it was no longer possible to flood and drain the Coliseum. That makes sense. And that is from Dave Stimple. Dave, that was great. To the point, the Thorotative. Like a shake from Jim Carter. That's right. If you want to get in touch with us like Dave, Dave did, Dave's got a great handshake too, I'm sure. You can send us an email.
