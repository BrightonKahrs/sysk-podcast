Hey everybody, it's your old pal Josh, and for this week's Selective Chosen, does the body replace itself every seven years? Sounds like a medical episode and it kind of is, but after a little while it turns into a brain buster of a headscratcher, of a philosophical bent that I think you're going to love. I hope you enjoy the living heck out of it. Welcome to Stuff You Should Know, a production of I Heart Radio. Hey and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark with Charles W. Chuck Bryant and guest producer Noel. Noel's in the house. It's the end of the new studio. Yeah, and his place is comfy, cozy. I like it. I wish there was a chair version of a waterbed. I know, this is a nampish little place. Yeah, especially the company comes from dragging old apologies. Yeah, same here. So if we're talking kind of slow or low or we just stop talking for a little while, it's, where's tired? Yeah, bumped into you at the Hawks Game last night. I know. Hey how many of you are on that? Yeah. The bump in. Yep. We're both at the Hawks Game in the Hawks One. Didn't even know we were going. Look over in a line. There's Josh and you and me. Yeah. That's great. There's Chuck and Eddie. Yep. It's a fantastic day together. And a arena of 18,000 bump into someone. Is that it? That's all it holds? I think it's something like that. It's a good lot of people. It's a good arena. Yeah, but you had box seats because you're special. They were free. I hope my word free too. I'm gonna go to the next one. Yeah. Yeah. I like to say about every seat in that place. Yeah. It's not too bad. I was laughing about the nosebleeds going in. But then I got up there. I was like, this is great. Yeah. You can see everything. Did you know it was actually bleed? Just twice. Yeah. Once out of a cheer excitement. Right? And then once from the altitude. And that was more of a spray. Yeah. Yeah. Just covering everyone. But I mean, it kind of jibes a little bit. Yeah. Because we're talking, yeah. You're mentioning blood. Sure. I was shedding cells and blood. You were like blood is made up of cells. And we shed tons of cells. But before we get to that, right? There's the fact that the podcast, you shed cells. I want to mention this one thing I read. Yeah. It's called, I think the title of the article is The Self is Moral. Yeah. It's about like where we get our identity of self from. Like where it's rooted. It was written by a person named Nina Strowmyer, I believe, it was on Aion magazine. Yeah. Just type in the self as Moral. Aion. It'll come up. That'll catch it there. And toward the beginning, the author says, there's this very famous philosophical exercise, which you know, philosophers love to do mental exercises. Yeah. That's what that's all they have. So imagine you have like, kind of a kind of, you know. Imagine you have like a ship, right? Okay. Like a boat. Yeah. Nice Yankee Clipper. Okay. And this Yankee Clipper is slowly over time, kind of salvage for parts. Okay. But rather than just being stripped, like every time a part is taken out, it's replaced. Yeah. And then over the course of like 50, 100 years, as each plank, as each bolt, as each like, massed head, even the thing that carved lady in front. Yeah. Eventually just gets replaced with something else. Yeah. A new carb lady that speaks of the time. Right. You know. Is it still though after every single part has been replaced, the same ship that it was before? Yeah. I see what you mean. I don't think that can be possible. Why not? Especially if it has the same name. And it's the same ship in the same place as before. It was just slowly over time. So moved out. True. Where does the self lie? Yeah. That's a good point, man. Like reading a house, same thing. Yeah. I mean, like all the floors and the walls and the windows, like, when does it cease to become that same house that was built in 1930? Exactly. Isn't that cool? Yeah. It is really cool. And the reason that it applies to this episode is because over the course of your lifetime, a significant portion, pretty much all of the cells in your body, are going to be replaced so that the person, even after you reach your adult self, yeah, physically. By the time you die, assuming you're going to die much later, you are essentially a different person, at least on the cellular level. Yeah. 37 trillion cells. Is that how many we have? Yeah. That's what they estimate. They're like, well, looking into life's man's time. It sounds like an estimate. 37 trillion. Yeah. What do you want? Like they're like give or take. Yeah. I did a little research into life's man's just because this all sort of comes back to like your death, basically. Yeah. Is that all death is? Is your cells, you know, dying, little by little? Well, yeah. I mean, if you think about it, Chuck, one of the things that, like, why do we die if we're going to die? Yeah. We'll get to all that. Oh, okay. But it's intriguing, you know, it is. It started, you know, questions started popping up. So apparently we gain about three months, every three months of life, humanity, every year that we progress. Like the average lifespan expands by three months. Yeah. Like if you were born in 2012, the average lifespan is now. And this is the United States is 78.8. And if you were born in 1901, it was about 47 and 50 years for men and women, respectively. But if you look at the ratio, it's still about three months, despite all our technologies, three months, a year, every year, every year. Just slowly creeping along. Yeah. Because the think of article, it was like when we're going to live to be 100 by average. And they say, by the year 2100, if things hold, then the average human or the American will be about 100 years old. I thought that. So I guess that would be a good idea. If things are steadily progressing, I had heard that like our generation would be either the last or the first, the last to not hit triple digits or the first two. On average. Yeah. Yeah. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I applied to computers though, and that's right. Right. But I mean, you can expand it to other stuff. Yeah. Then you might think, you know, it's, but you know, they say it's not increasing like that. No. At least not so far. Moore's law is exponential growth just adding three months every year's non-exponentials. Geometric. I think we're still at non-exponential growth. Definitely. Yeah. We're just adding three months. Yeah. It's not bad though. That's pretty good average. Every four years. That's an extra year. Well, in this session, you think about, you know, people that were born, you know, a lot of our colleagues, like eight years behind us, we're going to live an average of two years longer. Yeah. That seems unfair. That's sad. Yeah. I know. What did they do? Just observe that. We're thinking about our own deaths today. Yeah. And check that there's this rumor theory legend, maybe. Okay. That your body regenerates itself. 95% of your body regenerates itself every year. Yeah. That's not true. No. It's not true. But it was a very long standing rumor and it was actually based on science. Yeah. You know, not just the idea that, oh, yeah, ourselves regenerates. So back at the envelope, estimate is that, you know, we regenerate 95% or 98% of ourselves every year. Mm-hmm. It was early experimentation by injecting radioactive isotopes into human beings. Yeah. And then following their course and then making estimates based on that, led to this idea, it's called pulse labeling. Is it, yeah, it's like tagging an animal in the wild, basically. Right. But you're just tagging itself. Yeah. For specific types of cells. Yeah. They don't do that to humans anymore. No. They do animals in it. It's a very dumb thing to do. Sure. Checking radiation. Exactly. Yeah. Unless, of course, you know, it's radiation treatment. That's true, which is still a really weird thing if you think about it. Yeah. I have a feeling it's going to be like one of the things we look back on as like a primitive treatment. Yeah. Yeah. I hope so. But there was this longstanding science for decades or this idea, scientific idea that we regenerated ourselves by 95-98%. Finally, and I think 2005. There was a researcher named Dr. Jonas Freeson. He was Swedish. It's a really awesome. He said, this whole urban legend is really bringing me down. I want to figure out a way to really track how often the human body regenerates itself. Yeah. And the biggest question has been the brain, specifically the cerebral cortex and the heart and the heart muscles. I mean, they want to know all the stuff, but those were the two biggest mysteries, I think. Right. There's still the mysteries, but if you went back to prior to 2005 and Dr. Freeson's research, it was all a mystery. Yeah. He figured out that he basically put a very accurate timestamp on how often human tissue and human cells regenerate themselves. Yeah. So the way he did this is very clever. For a long time, botanists knew that the trees around the world contained a spike of carbon-14 radiation. Yes. Thanks to humans and nuclear bombs. Exactly. From 1954 to 1963, tree rings for tree growth around the world show a big spike in carbon-14. Carbon-14 is naturally occurring too. So just cosmic rays from the sun, bombard Earth's atmosphere and create radioactive isotopes by knocking electrons from particles in Earth's atmosphere. Right. Those radioactive particles become carbon-14, which is radioactive. And in the atmosphere, carbon-14 binds to oxygen and creates carbon dioxide, which comes to Earth. Every living thing breeds this stuff in, whether it's a plant, whether it's a human. Yeah. We just have C-14 in our bodies. And we also eat plants. Exactly. Contain the C-14. And we also eat the animals that eat the plants that in just C-14. So like, we got carbon-14 in our bodies. That's right. But because of the spike in carbon-14 that was introduced to the atmosphere from nuclear testing. Yeah. There is a spike in humans as well. So you can roughly age like a human compared to another human. If they were born in say 1959 and one who was born in 1970, after there was that spike of carbon-14 in gone away. Right. That's pretty cool. But what Dr. Friesen did is even cooler. He basically went back to those tree trunks, those tree rings that show a spike in carbon-14. Yeah. And created a calendar. Ah, not so awesome. Of carbon-14 decay. And basically said, OK, on this date, this is how much carbon-14 was on Earth. Yeah. And if I take this cell and compare it, knowing that carbon-14 decays it of a constant rate, Yeah. I can tell you exactly how old the cell is exactly. And he used it to date cells and tissues and all sorts of cool stuff. Yeah. He went looking for a marker and he found one due to our atomic testing program, which is pretty weird. Just released all that junk in the atmosphere. And now, on these years later, it has a nice use. Yeah. You know? It does. So we now know when we're going to die. Right. Sort of. And the reason he was able to use this as a marker checkers is that when you take a breath of life, your first breath of life, that's right. And you get some of that C-14 into your DNA. And a steady amount stays in there. Like you don't keep ingesting C-14 as far as I understand. As far as your DNA goes. Okay. Once it's in your DNA, as your cells divide, yeah. That original amount becomes divided evenly. Right. So the less C-14 that's in tissue, the older those that cell line is. Right. The younger the actual cells are. Right. Is that right? I think so, which would mean the new cell, the marker would be a fresh batch of the C-14. No, it have less C-14. Oh, really? Yeah, let's say you have, because the cell divided, yes. Exactly. Yeah. Like you have 10 grams of C-14, which you don't. Yeah. Can imagine. But that would be like, let's say you're one cell that's never divided has 10. Yeah. When it divides into two, each of those two cells is going to have five grams. Right. And then two and a half. And then 1.75 and so on and so on. So since you know that C-14 is generated at a counter rate, you know that it decays at a half life of 5,730 years. Yeah. You can look at the amount of C-14. And then also the decay of it as well. Yeah. You can date things that are no longer living too to see when they ingested that C-14 was. Yeah, he's a little like a bingo card. He just from the calendar that he made of the trees. And he holds it up in the light. And that's how he determines it. But what he did determine that was, which is really cool. And this is sort of what we've been building toward is that most of your cells are about seven to 10 years old. Yes. And the body. And there are variances. And of course we're going to talk about all that. And right after this break, we're going to give you a little primer on cells. So you know what all this means. Right. Hi, I'm Kristen Bell. Getting help from my anxiety made me feel like myself again. But we have all sorts of reasons for putting off taking care of ourselves. I thought I could just keep pushing through my depression symptoms. Let's push through dinner with the in-laws, not life. I don't want medication to change why I am. Understood. But what if it helps you feel like yourself again? I hope my depression would just go away after a while. Same. But for me, it was kind of like wishing away my taxes.

We were promised to sell primer and we like to deliver on those promises here at stuff you should know. So I guess we started off by saying there are 37 trillion cells about in the human body. Yeah, give or take and water makes up about 2-thirds the weight of those cells. Oh yeah. That's right. They're tiny. You need a microscope to see them. And it's the like it's the tiniest thing that can still reproduce. Yeah. And even though we have many different kinds of cells, I think 200 types. And within those cells there are differences, but there are a lot of similarities with all cells in their structure. Namely, they have a cell membrane. They have a nucleus. They have a nucleus. And there are some more than one. And these membranes are what allows nutrients to pass in and out. Waste to pass out. Water through osmosis travels in. Reverse osmosis travels out. Yeah. And what else? So you got your mitochondrion as well. That's where this is the important, really important thing which is basically what keeps your cells alive. That's the power center, right? Yeah. Your cells need food to live just like your body does. But you can't pass that hamburger straight into your cell. Right. It needs to be broken down so your cell can use it. Exactly. And what? Adenosine triphosphate. ATP is like the universal cell fuel, right? Yeah. So there's a lot of stuff that the body does make. I think you need like 23. And like nine of them, your body doesn't really manufacture. So those are the nine non essential amino acids, right? And you use amino acids to build proteins and use proteins for everything from making muscles to making red blood cells to your mounting and immune response proteins are very, very vital. And some of them, you have to build by eating stuff from your environment, right? Yeah. So you go out and you find yourself a nice pig and you cut off its back leg. You say, sorry, pig. Here's a pig leg for you. But I need this leg. I'm going to eat this leg and what I'm really eating is the muscle. What I'm really really eating is the glutamine. Yeah. And then my body is going to take this glutamine. It can make it itself, but it doesn't hurt to have an extra little bit of glutamine. Yeah. It doesn't hurt to have that pig leg in your back. Exactly. Right. So I'm chomping on the pig leg. You need to pick some of the vegetarian listeners like me. Right. I'm going to use your imagination for a second. Sure. And yes, I'm sorry, too. Yeah. So you're eating the pig leg and you're gaining this glutamine as a result. And your body's metabolizing the glutamine and then reusing it. Right? Yeah. And it can be glutamine. It can be anything. If we're ingesting a protein, if we're ingesting a amino acids, or if we're eating any kind of food, sugars, whatever, our bodies break it down into its constituent parts. And then a lot of those constituent parts become part of our bodies. Yeah. So if you think about it in this sense when we eat when we breathe, we're taking in stuff we need from the environment. Yeah. And that stuff that we take in from the environment becomes a part of us. Literally, physically on the molecular level. Yeah. It becomes a part of us. For better or worse, depending on what it is, of course. Yeah. Yeah. And then we're ultimately one of the side lessons of this whole thing is we should take care of our environment because that environment becomes us. And we either suffer or thrive as a result of it. You ever heard the expression you are, what you eat? Exactly. You literally are what you eat. Quite literally. And then also check it goes, it goes the other way as well. When we excrete waste, when we exhale, CO2. Yeah. That's taken up by other things in the environment. Deposit it into the environment. And it becomes part of the environment itself. Yeah. So not only do we regenerate ourselves, regenerate tissue, every on average seven to 10 years, become almost wholly a new version of ourselves. Yeah. We also, the boundary between us and the surrounding environment is really non-existent because there's a constant exchange of molecules. Yeah. We lose average, they say, 90, the average adult male loses 96 million cells per minute. But we also replace those at the rate of 96 million per minute. Yeah. Yeah. So that's the good news. So we've got all these cells that we're losing. We've got all these new cells that are replacing them. And I think, like you said earlier before the break, that these different types of cells and then hence different tissues regenerated a different rate. Right? Yeah. And they all have specialized jobs and the cells are often built in such a way to aid that job physically different to make that job easier, which is really cool too. Right. She was a versatile, they are. Yes. Like stem cells are very versatile, super. So let's say you're skin. Yeah. Your skin regenerates every two to four weeks, I think. Yeah. Exactly. You get a new healthy coding of skin every two to four weeks because your epithelial cells are particularly good at regenerating themselves. That's right. And that is, well, I guess that would fall on the low side. Obviously, if we're talking seven to ten years on the super low side, you have the cells that line like you're in test and you've got. And those things don't last long at all because it's such a harsh environment. You know, you wouldn't expect them to last like weeks and months and years. But I think they want to get five days. Yeah. That's nothing. But the structure of your guts, the, the, the, the, the beneath that membrane lining that turns over five days is they last about 15 years. Yeah. It's such a, like, a beautiful elegant system that we have. All right. To keep us alive. Red blood cells last about 120 days. But then you have things like cells in your bone, which actually regenerate as well. So your bones are, are over time over much longer period of time. Actually, becoming, I mean, I hate to call them new bones. But the kind of are, you know. Well, yeah, I mean, compared if you took your femur and somehow compared it to your femur when you were 15 years old, like they are two totally different bones. Even though they're your bones. Yeah. They were in the same place going in the same person with the same DNA. They're still different bones. Yeah. And that's made of different cells. 10 years or so for the bones. Yeah. Something like that for the human skeleton. Uh, 300 to 500 days for the liver. Very important organ. It is. And one of the other cool things about the liver is it's just gangbusters that regenerating itself. Yeah. You can apparently cut out 95% of a person's liver and it will grow back. And you won't have full function, but it will function. Yeah. You'll survive with just 5% of your liver. That's pretty amazing actually. Yeah. Because it will just grow right back. Kind of like a hornet's nest. Interestingly, the inner lens cells of your eye form in your embryo and basically don't change. Yeah. Now, is that why you have suffer from degeneration and vision? That's what I would guess. Is that the reason? Yes. So with the corneal lens, choke when you're born when you're conceived. Right? You are a cell that divides. Yeah. And once that first division takes place, those corneal cells, they're set in stone. Like your corneal cells are as old as you are. Same age as you. Other cells that make up different parts of the eyes, they're far newer. But your corneal cells, your cerebral cortex cells, they think. Yeah. That's the one. I mentioned the brain and the heart muscles. Those are the two big ones because obviously the reason we have diseases like Alzheimer's and dementia are because this cerebral cortex has long thought to not regenerate cells at all. Yeah. Now I think they believe that they do in a very small number. Or different regions like the old factory bulbs supposedly does? Yeah, in the hippocampus. So we can learn new things. There are sense of smell can be refined over time. Yeah. And I think isn't that also the reason the smell is very much tied to your memory? Probably. Like a smell can conjure up a memory more clearly. Yeah. But the cerebral cortex itself, they don't think. Who was her name? Elizabeth Gould. Princeton did a lot of work on this because it was just basically set in stone for years. Like, no, it doesn't happen. And she did a lot of work over the years trying to prove that it did. Using tracer studies and I think that where they are now as they think it does some. Yeah. Here they're here there. But obviously we still have to mention Alzheimer's. So it's not, it doesn't regenerate like the rest of the body. And I'm close. Yeah. Alzheimer's also may be produced, I guess, by plaques. I'm a plaque buildup. Oh yeah. I'm between your neurons that keep them from firing as well. Yeah. But it seems like we're so close to figuring out the secret. You know, yeah, to, uh, I don't know about not dying ever. I'm not talking immortality, but um, living much longer lives. Well, let's talk about that because all of this stuff kind of leads to that question if we regenerate. So often, why do we die? And we'll address that right after this. Hi, I'm Kristen Bell. Getting help from my anxiety made me feel like myself again. But we have all sorts of reasons for putting off taking care of ourselves.

There's this idea that if we are regenerating ourselves, we're like the vast majority of our bodies cells regenerate. Why do we age and why do we die? It doesn't really make sense in that respect. Yeah, it's what they think is it has to do with your DNA actually in the cell. Our cells as we age, even the new ones, they get replaced, which really stinks. Become what they call a senacent, which means that they can't divide any longer. We've talked about the hayflick limit before or a replicative senacent is basically how many times your cells can divide over its lifetime. Yeah, and I think a fiber-ablast, which is the cells of the connective tissue in mammals, is about 50 cell divisions. Yeah, and then it hits that point of senacents and it starts sending out repair signals to your body that aren't necessary. And that causes inflammation. And we've talked about inflammation kind of being the source of most of the original problems that will eventually lead to your death. You know, something becomes inflamed and leads to all kinds of problems. There's no repair needed. So it's a false signal. So they're trying to come up with drugs now. There's one called a rap a my scene that tries to stop the cells from sending out those false signals. Which is amazing. Yeah, that would be wonderful. There's another explanation for it as well as that when our cells divide, especially over time as we age, they're basically making photocopies of themselves. Yeah. And you ultimately years down the road and up making photocopies of photocopies. Right. And those don't tend to pan out very well. So as far as analogies go, that one kind of makes sense that yes, we have brand new cells. But the DNA copies, the DNA blueprints that they're based on have seem better days. Yeah. Many years back, you know. Yeah, that makes sense. It's good to say it. We also talked a little bit about whether or not the heart muscle itself replenishes itself in the cells. And for a long time they had no idea. But now, thanks to our buddy, Dr. Frisson. He, he's pretty much, I don't think we said what his, who he works with did we? No. He works with the, with the K, Carolin Schottim. Yeah. Just like incredible scientists that are making like amazing advancements and trying to figure the stuff out. Mm-hmm. But they did, in fact, find that the heart does replace itself, the muscle cells. About 1% of the heart muscles replaced every year at age 25. Mm-hmm. And that falls over your lifetime to less than half a percent per year by the age 75. I spoke too soon. That does make sense. Yeah. So what they basically said is about half of your heart's muscle cells will be exchanged during a normal lifetime. Okay. Which is okay. It is, but it's slowing down over time. I mean, the heart's kind of essential. Yeah, but they're hoping again to develop drugs that can accelerate that process too. Yeah. I don't know how far along they are on that, but that'd be amazing. So there's this whole thing that kind of came up to me, man. Like that. I don't, all of this raises this question to me. Right? Yeah. Like you or me or any living thing as an investment, like a molecular investment in the ability to reproduce. Right? Okay. Once you finish your reproductive age, yeah. Then it does make sense that you would just kind of, there would be built in this mechanism of aging and then death. And then decay, which is what we do. We return back to the earth to put it in kind of biblical terms. There's like that whole ashes that ashes dust to dust thing. Sure. It is very, very true. And if you look at us and you look at all living things as something that exchanges molecules with the external environment, takes them in, puts them out. Mm-hmm. Right? And you look at us as all connected in that sense. Yeah. Like we're just like a plant. Exactly. Or we're just like a rock. Yeah. Like we're all that stuff and those things are us because we're able to exchange basic ingredients. Then it makes total sense that a person would come together, be conceived, start dividing themselves, you know, make more of itself, and then start to age and then die into K. Yeah. And then it would give something else a chance to come up from that again, right? Sure. But then it makes you, it makes you wonder what's the point of that? What do you mean? Like think about it. If we're just the same as plants. Like why are we all here? Yeah. Like if we're, if the whole point is to just basically recycle materials because we are just recycling stuff from the environment and we're recycled as we die into K. Yeah. What is the point? Is our point just to be part of the carbon cycle? So we're moving carbon in and out of ourselves and in and out of the environment moving it around. Or I don't understand what the point is of life, I guess is what I'm saying here in the analyst. No, I'm not saying I don't believe that there isn't a point. I'm just curious what it is because if we are the same as any other living thing and the definition of living is an exchange with an active exchange with the surrounding environment, breathing, or eating whatever. Yes. Then if you kind of take that a little further and say, well clearly we're meant to reproduce or something like that. And then after that we age and die. What's the point? Like why not just have one species of living thing and just let that do all of your carbon recycling or whatever? Yeah. I think are you about to quit the show? Yeah. Yeah. See what you mean. Like if we look at ourselves as a purely mechanical serving a purely mechanical function on the planet. Like we are to the carbon cycle, what say evaporation is to the rain cycle. Like we're a means of moving something along. Well, I think that's when you, man, this is getting philosophical. I think that's when you start getting into questions of the soul. Yeah. I mean it kind of makes you wonder like well why would there be more than one species? It would be much more efficient. It just have one maybe two. There's all these different ones. So why? Yeah. The fact that that why is just sitting there and flashing neon lights definitely made me wonder. Basically the opposite. It's made me think in a different direction than nihilistically. Right. In a like we're only here for so long and so if the point is to like make the most of your time on that. Well, I think that's a separate, that's a separate part of it. Yeah. Because no matter what conclusion you come to whether nope we're just a means of recycling carbon and that is it. Yeah. If it kind of like a guy theory view of things. Right. Or if you say no like the the the fact that we're inefficient and redundant as far as that carbon recycling thing goes. Yeah. Suggest that maybe there is a higher purpose to us. Either way. I feel like you come to the conclusion or you should come to the conclusion that. The one thing we do know is that we are here right now and the best thing we can do is make the absolute best of it for ourselves and for other people as well. Yeah. And there are probably others out there that think the whole point is to make as much cash as you can. Sure. Sure. And by products. Yeah. That Roberna is probably say that. Yes. He would live that way then. Man, that's interesting. I think we should have I'd love to tackle something philosophical and deep like the soul. Meaning of life. Yeah. That'd be tough. I mean that'd be cool though. It would be cool. We don't delve into that very much. No. We should. I'd like to do that. And consciousness. That's a really interesting one too. Like it doesn't make any sense. It's a very trippy way forward for this show. Yeah. We're going to start getting weird. I took a lot of acid this morning. Oh. That's great. If you want to know more about some of this weird trippy stuff, how stuff works has a surprising amount of it on there. I don't know. Just try typing the word trippy into the search bar. You can also type this your body really replaces stuff every seven years and it will bring up this cool article. And I think I said search bar at some point in time. So how about some listener mail? I like how you specify that you took a lot of acid. Not just the little. Yeah. There's a lot of it. All right. I'm going to call this multiple. We had we got like a bunch of emails in one day about people picking at our grammar and things. Oh yeah. So I'm just sad to read three of them because they're short. Okay. Hey guys, I generally enjoy the episodes. But you do have one issue with your grammar and noun verb agreement. You tend to say there are many lines of evidence or there's lots of experiment showing Instead of there are not there is. When the pronoun refers to a play of subject check yourselves next time guys. You typically make them steak about 10 times every show. Why don't you go recycle some carbon pal? That's from Kim Keller in Temple Terrace, Florida. Thanks. I always like to pick apart their emails too about because people usually make a mistake or doing their own emails. Hey guys, this is from Blair. I love the show. I hate to be nitpicky. They always say they don't. Yeah, right before they nitpick. But I have a grammar correction. It's been bugging me for months. And Stonehenge was a major defender at least one of you not naming names. I frequently use the word further when you really mean farther. The latter term is used for literal distances. Further is only supposed to be used figuratively. Huh. Didn't know that. Okay. So thanks Blair. Yeah. And Phil, who is an English and grammar pronunciation freak. He says, hey guys, when there's an Italian word, you take your time to pronounce it properly. Same with Japanese and the Far East and general. So why don't you extend that same courtesy to English words? Because we're masters of the language. And I mean words actually in the UK vernacular, not American English. Salaspary? No. It's Salspary. The Marlboro Downs? Nope. Marlboro Downs. Well, we're using the American vernacular because we're in America and recording as Americans. That's from Phil. I had addressed all those I think. Yeah, I think that's a good about it. I think it's good and very big of you to have read those as listener mail. Why not? Nice job, man. Yeah, we just. We don't profess to talk good or than other people. We just do our little thing here in the studio. Send it out into the world. Nice. For people to pick apart. What we're doing is we're creating grammatical tabloes like that highlights magazine where it's like pick out things that don't belong. Yeah, that's what we're doing for you guys. Yeah, keep you entertained. If you didn't have something to complain about and so boring. Yep.
