Hey and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark and there's Charles W. Chuck Wright and Jerry and this is Stuff You Should Know. The podcast. Hey, congratulations to Jerry. Oh yeah, she's got married. Congratulations Jerry. Wait a go. She just gave her thumbs up. Yeah, she is the right germane scientist. So congratulations to Jerry and Anna and sadly Jerry had to go to a different state to get married. Yeah, but she did it. Yes. Because they have initiative. That's right. Don't you, Jerry. Yeah. That was a big deal. Nice. Yeah, congratulations, Jerry. Yeah, we're very happy for you guys. Um, so happy in fact that we have a podcast. I just realized I said I'm very happy for you guys and has sounded not at all happy for them. That's not very happy for you. Yeah, I'm really happy for you guys. Uh, yeah. But I think everybody bought that you're happy for him. Okay. Everybody knows you. They know me. Well, Jerry bought it and that's what counts. Judy, did you buy it? He's thinking, maybe he can see himself. Interesting. I like your French Chuck. Thanks this morning. I know how to say. Uh, is it? No, I mean, I've got the Banzuer down and. Okay. Frost fries. Okay. Frost bread. Oh, frost dressing. Frost dressing. Yeah. Uh, so you say all those things. French dressing, French bread, French fries. And I can tell you that none of them were around 20,000 years ago. Nice segue. It wasn't, oh, it was pretty clumsy. I like it. It felt clumsy, but thank you. Yeah. Are you talking about the paleo diet? Yeah. Which by the way, is short for paleo, lithic diet. And um, this thing's been around longer than I thought. The book was written by a guy named Dr. Lauren Cordane, the creator of the paleo diet back in 2002. And um, Dr. Cordane is no slouch. He is a celebrated PhD in health and health sciences. Um, and he started looking at the massive chronic health problems that face Westerners and Americans in particular. I think we might be the most chronically unhealthy country in the world. Yeah. As far as like that, BDs, obesity, heart disease, all of these things go. And Dr. Cordane was like, there's gotta be a better way. And what he focused on was the idea that the Western diet is also a very modern diet. Full of processed foods, foods that are prepared, pre-packaged, boxed even, a lot of my pictures of the food on the box. Lading with chemicals. Yes, definitely. But it's definitely not going to do at home. Right. Stuff that tastes really good, mainly because it's been designed to taste really good. The problem is that Dr. Cordane believes the stuff's really bad for us because of those preservatives, chemicals. And a lot of the good stuff that was present in at one point has been worked out or moved. So his idea was, well, let's create a diet that's the opposite of modern. That's pre-historic even. And what he came up with was the paleo or paleolithic diet. And the paleolithic era ended at about the advent of agriculture. So the premise of the diet is like, all of the stuff would be the same diet that a hunter gather would eat. Yeah, and the idea is, and this is, there's a lot of controversy, not everyone believes this. And there's controversy with every diet. But if you subscribe to this, the idea is that our body chemistry and physiology has not changed. Like if you look at a, if you think of it like a hundred yard football field, we went 99 yards as hunter gathers. And then the last yard is since agriculture has come around. That's the longest yard. So our bodies have not changed genetically. And they're the same way they were back then. So to eat how they were back then. And they did for thousands and thousands of years, makes more sense. I'm concerned with that analogy with what happens when we score a touchdown. I don't know. Like is that the end of humanity? I don't know. But the dude you mentioned, he wasn't the first. I was actually a guy in the 70s at wrote a book. Walter Votin wrote a self-published book in 75 called The Stone Age Diet. Oh, I didn't know that. Based on in-depth studies of human ecology and the diet of man. But like I said, it was self-published and he didn't like, it didn't blow up. It definitely took till the 2000s to gain traction. Has court day like given this guy credit? I don't know. Like he's based his ideas on this guy or what? I don't know. But I think he was the first guy to actually coin that term. I got you. But yeah, these are people who subscribe to that notion that since we haven't changed it as he logically and how we're supposed to eat them, we shouldn't be eating how we're eating. Right. We should eat how we used to eat. I would suggest that that's not necessarily true. Part of the problem with saying things like that or saying like, you know, this is how a paleolithic body, human body absorb nutrients or right. These are the nutrients that could absorb. You're making a pretty broad and unsubstantiated claim in and of itself. Yeah, they did okay. Well, also, you don't have the paleolithic body to dissect to study. All you have are modern bodies and assumptions about what paleolithic diets were like. Now I mean, there are still hunter-gatherer tribes currently. But I haven't seen anybody say, well, we study these hunter-gatherer tribes specifically for a very long time. And we've concluded that this paleo diet is totally supported by this. It's basically people saying, you know, this is what paleolithic people would have eaten. Right. So this is how their body would have been. And when they make a step to that second sentence, you're making a jump into an unsubstantiated claim. Just keep that in mind. Yeah, yeah. That's all. And like you said, every every diet on earth is you're going to find studies that say they're great and studies that say they're not so great. Yeah. You're going to find people who say the food pyramid is what you should look at. Other people that say the food pyramids out of whack and we shouldn't be eating that many grains. Oh, yeah. The food pyramid is how to whack. Yeah, but like, you know, there is no definitive writer wrong, I think, because every time there's a study done, it seems like there's another study that can refute it. You just hit the nail on the head. There is no writer wrong because we don't understand our bodies and our bodies metabolic processes enough. Yeah. Say this one's right in this one's wrong for everybody. Yeah, you know, there's no there's no baseline that's been established. We don't know quite enough yet. And so the problem has been as we've said ourselves back decade after decade by basically picking a study, whichever one got the most media play and seen the most sensible. Yeah. And going with that, throwing lots of money and education time and effort at bolstering that the findings of that study, even though it may or may not have been the case, rather than just saying like, oh, we're still figuring it out. In the meantime, we think maybe don't eat so much of this or whatever. Yeah. And I think that that's set us back quite a bit. Well, I'll talk about more later. Yeah. And I think just personally like, if you're doing it healthily, then find something that works for you, if that sugarbusters great, if that's atkins or if that's weight watchers or Jenny Craig or super calorie restriction or whatever, not everything is going to work for everyone. Right. You know, or paleo, you know, what are the other names? The warrior diet or the caveman diet. Yeah. They're, you know, they're fads, but that doesn't mean there can't be something to some of them for some people. Well, the other thing I think about diets that makes each one so controversial too is that they do end up ultimately being fads. But every single one of the diets aspires to be that one diet that works for everybody. Right. They all kind of claim that. And that's the cell books, you know, it's get real. But there are, it's not like these things are necessarily just totally made up out of whole cloth like no. Well, we'll talk about the paleo diet and the basis of it, right? So the whole idea is that like I said, the modern diet has a lot of foods involved in it that are not good for you. And by cutting those things out, that's step one. Yeah, basically eating cleaner. Right. But step two isn't just like, okay, so anything that you can find growing on a tree or, you know, that has a face and you can eat it. Yeah. Besides humans is healthy for you. Yeah. There's, if you take it a little bit further, there's some things that you really shouldn't eat according to the paleo diet. One of the things that it's centered around are foods that if you have to cook them to gain nutrients from them, like beans are a really good example. Right. You can't eat them. Right. You don't want them. In the case of the paleo diet, the reason is they affect gut health supposedly. Right. What else? Well, I mean, should we just go ahead and talk about what is on the good list and the bad list? Yeah. And you've probably heard of the diet before, especially lately, but generally, very high in protein. Yeah. And a lot of people make the mistake of saying, like, oh, it's just like eating huge stakes all the time and, you know, pulling, pulling women by their hair. Like it's like that. It's actually, no, they say proteins like 15 or 19 to 35 percent of the diet. Right. Whereas protein for the average diet here in the West is about 15 percent. Right. And more protein. And when we say protein, we mean poultry and pork and fish and eggs. And, you know, even red meat is on there, of course. Right. Then lower carbohydrates, like a lower amount of carbohydrates and different kinds of carbohydrates. So, that's right. The carbs you want are slow burning carbs. Yeah. And the idea behind this extends beyond just the paleo diet. There's a lot of diets including atkins that believe in lowering carbs. Yeah. And they base it on, but it's not no carbs. You do want some carbs because your body does need some energy. Right. But you, you do want some carbs, but you want carbs from things like an apple or from celery or black olives. Things that are slow burning carbs that will give you energy without raising your blood sugar. Yeah. Something with them low on the glycemic index. Yeah. So, something that has about a 55 or lower on the glycemic index is considered low. Yeah. And that's what you want as far as a carbohydrates is concerned because it is going to give you energy without raising your blood sugar. When you raise your blood sugar, as I think we've talked about recently, the insulin comes out to stabilize your blood sugar. Well, insulin sends a signal to your liver to start producing fat for storage. Right. And then, you tend to gain weight when you eat carbohydrates because your blood sugar spikes in your insulin comes out. Yeah. And the difference, like, that's a difference between eating a sweet potato or a regular baked potato. Sweet potato good, baked potato not so good. Yeah. And it's glycemic index. Yeah. Both carbohydrates, though. Right. The problem is also, is the glycemic index is extraordinarily unproven still. It's a, I don't know that it's a relatively new thing, but it's been used much more frequently recently. But if you start really looking into the glycemic index, any reasonable source will say, like, here's the glycemic index. This is a pretty good understanding of it. But the difference between a tart apple and a very ripe sweet apple. Right. You can't just say apples have a glycemic index of whatever. Right. Like, one that's ripe in more than another, that's just the same exact apple from the same tree are going to have radically different glycemic indices. Yeah. That's interesting. That's a solid point too, because it seems like there are too many definitive statements about diet. Yes. When they're shouldn't be. Absolutely. The one that I think keeps coming up again and again, that's the most sensible is, we'll get to later, but it involves, it's moderation basically. Yeah. You know, being attention to your food is very important. Yeah. But moderation, you know, like eating a bunch of twinkies over the course of your life time is not going to kill you. Right. Twinkies a day, like that's still you. And that's a moderate. Right. Moderation is, I think, the key to health. I agree, man. That's sort of the key to, I think, most things in life. Yeah. I mean, it pops up everywhere. Moderation. All right. Moderation is the spice of life. No, I don't think that's the way it's. So fiber. Fibers are a big part of the Paleo diet. Fibers. Super great for your health. People are getting too much fiber from grains, or at least the thought is that you're getting too much fiber from your grains, whereas you should get it in things like fruits, maybe, or whole grains instead of refined grains. Non-starchy vegetables? Yeah. Yeah. In you, if you're counting carbs too, on like a low carb or no, carb restricted diet, like say, acnes or something, sure. You actually look at the total carbohydrates and then subtract dietary fiber to come up with what's called net carbohydrates and those are the ones that you actually count. Yeah. Because apparently fiber is kind of toward carbohydrates, which is why it shows up in things like non-starchy vegetables and things like that. But it doesn't raise your blood sugar, which is what we come back to again and again and again. As far as weight loss is concerned. Right. Right. Another part of the Paleo diet is fat intake, higher fat intake, but what they call the right kinds of fats. Omega 3 and Omega 6 fats mainly. Right. So you want to get into that? Yeah. I think it's time. So this is, well before we do, man, let's pull back from the precipice here and take a message great. You know, these days you can get your groceries delivered, you can turn on all the lights in your house with your phone, you can do all sorts of things easier than ever before.

So quickly to recap, things that you're going to be eating on the paleo diet are... Lots of protein. Lots of protein. Lots of vegetables. Slow burning carbohydrates. Fruts. Things that you might have hunted and gathered. But not a day. Not beans, not legumes. Not modern processed foods. Not salt. And refined sugar is a really big no-no. Yeah. And we got to fat. And this is extremely controversial. I thought this was super interesting. Well, the paleo diet, like pretty much any typical diet these days, recommends that you really take it easy on the animal fats. And the idea that the reason why pretty much everybody recommends you take it easy on animal fats, saturated fats, which are steric acid, pulmetic acid, and loric acid. Yeah. Those are the three biggest saturated fats found in animal fats. The idea that everybody has for steering clear of them is because they will give you heart disease, heart attacks, coronary disease. Yeah. If you eat too many saturated fats, you're going to die of a heart attack. Exactly. This idea gave rise to a complete change in diet among Americans and Westerners in general. The whole concept of a low fat diet, which is everywhere. You go to any storage, like fat free low fat, fat free low fat. Everything is low fat. Now there's a version of it's low fat. Yeah. It came from an initial study from the 50s by a guy named Ansel Keys who carried out what's called the six countries study. Yeah. And he basically was the first to link animal fat intake to heart disease. Yeah. And what did they call it? The diet heart hypothesis. Yes. And what stinks about that whole scene is that he sort of did the elementary school science fair project approach, which is he kind of ignored the data that didn't support what he wanted and cherry picked out the data that did and went with it. Somehow, like even though there was like some opposition to it at the time, somehow it became the basis for how Americans were told to eat from now on. Yeah. Even though it was flawed, I mean, for instance, one of the countries he studied was the United States, one of was Japan, and he kind of said, hey, they have way more heart attacks in the US than in Japan, and it's because he ate more fat. Yeah. They eat more animal fat. They have more heart attacks to go. He eats less animal fat and has fewer heart attacks. So fact, though, yeah, eating animal fat leads to heart attacks in heart disease. Right. Not not considering the amount of sugar Americans ate or bread or nothing. Lifestyle or anything. Yes. Now, he didn't, nothing else was controlled for. So that was part one. Part two is like you said, he cherry picked six countries that supported his hypothesis. And at the time, some other people pointed out, there's a lot of other countries. Yeah. For 22 countries. Yeah. And when you take all that data and do it, a survey across the 22 countries, a correlation between animal fat and take and heart disease, it goes away. That correlation dissolves. Not only dissolves, but like, the disproves it in some cases. Yeah. The death rate from heart disease in Finland, for instance, was 24 times that of Mexico, even though in Mexico, the fact consumption rate was twice as much as Finland. That's right. Complete opposite finding. So keys does the six country study in the 50s. And then in 1970, falls up with a seven country study. Who did he add? Well, he this time he did. Japan, Italy, the US, Greece, Yugoslavia, Finland, and the Netherlands. Okay. And he found that animal fat was a strong predictor of heart attacks over a five-year period. Again, they basically said, dude, what are you doing? Like you're not doing good science here. And it's unclear, I should say, it's unclear whether keys misrepresented his data. He published his findings, like all his findings. He wasn't like, I'm just not going to publish this. It was more like in his discussion at the end of the studies. He was saying, like, yeah, this kind of came up, but we're not paying attention to that. It doesn't matter. Right. So he doesn't necessarily misrepresent the facts. It seems like he was more a victim of the media saying, yes, there's the answer. We've been wondering why Americans died more hard attacks. This guy just figured it out. It's animal fat and it takes saturated fat. And it took off like a rocket from there in the seventies. Well, it sort of, I mean, it makes sense to the ear when you hear saturated fats. It sounds like, well, that's got to clog your arteries and give you heart attack. Cetrate it. Well, you know, it's saturated with the word saturated means that there's no double bonds of carbon in these fatty chains, fatty acid change. Yeah. So unsaturated means that there's at least one atom of carbon linked to another atom of carbon in the chain in a saturated fat. There's hydrogen carbons linking all of the carbon atoms together. That's it. It's saturated with hydrogen carbon. It doesn't mean that saturates your artery. It's right and clogs it up. Yeah. Which is what it sounds like. Exactly. And so keys comes up with this. It takes off like a rocket. It becomes adopted officially by the federal government to encourage a low fat diet. And study after study after study just kind of follows and keys footsteps. The thing is is if you really kind of look at these studies, especially ones that are just pointed to is like, these are definitive proof that the animal fat, that saturated fat intake produces heart attacks, they kind of all fall apart. And you realize that for decades now, we've just been taken as gospel, a first of all an unproven correlation as causation, like completely unproven. Yeah. As far as like, you know, unargutable evidence goes. Yeah. And there is definitely a dogma that's evolved around this that's been tough to crack. But a lot of scientists have been creating research and publishing research that says, look, man, we don't understand fat like you think it's not black and white and as simple as that. Like for example, there's LDL fat and there's HDL fat and people typically think that HDL is good fat LDL is bad fat cholesterol. Yes. Right. So if you have and your body uses cholesterol that did do things like produce hormones, especially sex hormones. Right. You need cholesterol, right. But it's the idea that your that animal fats raise your LDL, which is the bad cholesterol, right. That gave them this bad rap. But even if you look at LDL cholesterol, not all LDL cholesterol is the same. Right. There's different things called sub-fractions and depending on the sub-fraction, these start to correlate to heart disease finally, right? Right. Some are small dense types of LDL. Yeah. Some are puffy and pillowy. Right. Exactly. And the pillowy ones are fine. They seem to be totally fine. And what they found also is that the overall ratio of pillowy to dense LDL is what finally you can get a good predictor of heart disease risk, not just LDL cholesterol, right. So it's a ratio. Like you can't even say, oh, this guy's got a ton of small dense LDL particles. Right. And his bloodstream, so he's going to die of a heart attack. That's not necessarily true because you haven't taken into account the fluffiness. And if you have more fluffiness than dense, that's got to be particles, then it's going to even out. Yeah. Well, I like Ronald Krauss. He's a doctor out at UC Berkeley. He seems to be kind of hitting him on the head with at least how he's characterizing some of this stuff. Like one of his statements has struck me was he said it may. These findings may simply suggest that unsaturated fats are a healthier option, but not necessarily that saturated fats are killing you. Yes. And that's just a very reasonable thing to say to me. Yeah. He seemed like a very reasonable guy. You know when he came in the other day? Right. He's a nice dude. Well, in the start of the call, we should say this is that NBC really exhaustive NBC news article. Yeah. What if bad fat isn't so bad? It's really worth reading. Well, it is. And one of the lead, how the article leads in is super interesting. They have found tribes in Africa. One called the Mesae, nomadic tribe in Kenya, in Tanzania. And they basically live on a diet of fat, of supplemented with blood from cattle they heard, but they basically exist on red meat and whole milk. They're done. It's like 60 percent fat. Yeah. They're super lean and they're super healthy and their cholesterol levels were some of the lowest they've ever measured in people. Right. So people who responded to this, these these findings, they will obviously the Messiah have some sort of genetic predisposition do you know. Lower cholesterol somehow. There's something going on. No, because they studied a group of these these tribes people who moved to the city and basically adopted a western diet. And all of them just immediately, they went right into the normal levels of risk for heart disease. Yeah. So it's clear that it's not just animal fats that are associated with heart disease. And they may not really be associated with heart disease at all. We're kind of in the stage now where science is undoing the damage. Right. While it still hasn't figured out the true answer, they just know that the heart diet hypothesis has is not correct. Yeah. There's more to why did Congress in 1977 say this is the way to go, even though the American Medical Association said this is not necessarily true. Why did why is the food pyramid endorsed? Does it have something to do with people lobbying for grains like who knows? And apparently it wasn't just 1977. They very recently also the government endorsed an even lower saturated fat diet. They dropped the percentage of calories daily from 10% to 7%. Like this year, or last year. And the big problem with this is that it's not like, oh, all these people missed out on all that prime rib. They could have been eating the whole time. Right. That's not the problem with it. The problem is is like when we adapt or adopt this low fat diet, that's not the problem. That gives taste to food. Yeah. That's just delicious taste. It does. So when you remove fat, you're not going to sell a product that's just fat free or even low fat unless you add more salt or unless you add more sugar. But if you look at the nutrition info on a low fat product, like yeah, there's lower fat. But you got a lot more calories than you do in just the regular version of that side by side. Yeah. If you look at the medical records of every American, if you could, from the 60s to today, you would find that while we reduce our intake of fat by a third, race of obesity multiplied by almost three times. And then 11 times where people have diabetes. Yeah. And I think it's a truth that they found that people eat more of low fat foods because they think they can. Yes. Oh, it's just low fat mayo. So I'm going to slather up both sides of my sandwich bread. Yeah. Because it's low fat. And again, this, well, that's why, like I'm not a paleo diet guy, but I think there's definitely something to eat in cleaner. And, you know, a doctor in a nutritionist knows what they're doing. I'll tell you straight up, like, don't eat things from a box in your head and the right direction. Yeah. Yeah. It's true. Anything that's kind of been taken from its natural state. Even if it's like not in a box, like, for example, I did a brain stuff on what's the difference between whole milk and skin milk. Yeah. Well, skin milk is really, really, really messed around with milk. Yeah. I processed, you could say, whereas whole milk, you're like, oh, let's got a ton of fat. And I mean, like, that's cream mixed in there. That's, it's whole milk for a reason. It's not messed around with. Yeah. I mean, yes, there's the whole thing with antibiotics. And you may be lactose intolerant, but I'm just saying specifically from a nutritional point of view. Yeah. So, you have a whole milk, you have a whole milk. If you have a skin milk, you have milk that's had the fat removed and replaced with something like high fructose corn syrup or something like that. Some powdered milk proteins. It's, it's messed around. It's, it's processed. It's not the same thing. And the other problem with drinking anything but whole milk is that when you take the fat, the milk fats out, which, by the way, some, uh, Margaric acid has been shown to actually lower your risk of heart disease. Actually increase your HDL, good cholesterol. Right. When you take the milk fats out, you're also taking out the vitamin A and the vitamin D. Yeah. And those are fat soluble, which means that fat needs to be present for your body to absorb them. Yeah. And you can make up for that in other areas, but you have to know to do that. It's like people who jump on and become like vegan or vegetarian. They can have to do your homework. If you want to do that, that's great. You need to find a way to give your body the things that needs that maybe was in that milk or that red meat. Right. Like with the paleo diet, they say stay away from dairy, right, of which I disagree with. Yeah. I found that some paleo will drink dairy or ingest dairy. It's sort of a, but that definitely is an endorsed. But it's, it's interesting that like we're the only animal that drinks milk into their life after we're, you know, weaned off of it. Yeah. I thought it's definitely an odd thing. And I think that's why the paleo, they say not to drink milk because cavemen didn't, you know, go around milk and cows. No. I mean, we are reared to drink milk. We remember in the microbiome episode, we talked about how your, your mother's like gut bacteria's transferred to you. Yeah. So that you can break down breast milk. So apparently the newest thing that I saw was that lactose intolerance comes from the fact that everybody can digest milk. But they're only something like a third of humans keep maintain that ability to break down milk and everybody else loses as they age. It's because they're supposed to. Yeah. It's interesting. And I really thought about it before, but no one else put us drinks milk as adults. You know, even goats. They don't drink milk. So before we keep going, let's you mind doing another message break.

So Chuck, you said I wanted to also say you said that, you know, some paleo people say, well, you can still eat butter or something like that or drink milk. If you go on the paleo website and read stuff from Cordane, there's people out there who are like paleo experts. Right. And you can have a little burrow or something. He's like they're wrong. He's none of that. Yeah. He's basically saying like, what I wrote is right. Right. And like it's not an evolving concept that it's like, you can't eat legumes. You can't eat beans. Yeah. It's not okay. There is something called the 85-15 rule that he'd built into it, which I think was smart. What's that like 85% of the time, go paleo? Yes. You can have about three meals a week where that are non paleo and still get the benefits of the paleo diet according to the paleo diet. Well, they found, did they have any like definitive research? There is no definitive research on any of these, right? Like the paleo will cause you to be healthier. Yeah. I mean, no. Here's the thing. Like from this episode, I think the one thing everybody should walk away with, besides an understanding of the basics of the paleo diet. So are you saying this is the takeaway? Yes. All right. The takeaway is as follows, Chuck. If you see a study in an article, click on the link and read the abstract. And see if the sample size is enough to convince you that it's a believable study. Yeah. We didn't even get into the four studies that a lot of the saturated fat argument is based on throughout the years, but there are four notable ones that are always pointed to. And every single one of them are flawed in some way. Yeah. There's a problem with it. And I say that also because like even the article that we have on how stuff works, sites of 2009 study published in cardiovascular diabetology, which is a journal. And it found that people with type two diabetes who followed the paleo diet for three months benefited more than those who followed a standard recommended diet for diabetics. That just sounds like a problematic study. Well, it's, but if you just read that sentence, right. This is a very typical sentence for any media article. Yeah. You're like, oh, well, that proves that the paleo diet works. At least there's one study out there that proved that it works. But if you click the link and read the abstract, there were 13 people in the study. 10 men and three women. They were, they carried it out for two consecutive three-month periods. Wow. And like sure, okay, the findings proved that among these 13 people, the paleo diet was better. Right. For people with type two diabetes, then a diabetic diet. And, but then can you extrapolate that? Yeah. And the problem is, is like, even on our beloved house of works website, the way that the media is set up, it's like, here, here's something that proves my point. Yeah. Here's something. It's like a trap almost. Yeah. And it's just, if you, if you as a consumer or a thinking person, can just go a step further and just click that link. Like, I almost guarantee you whatever study is being discussed. The journalist is, you know, link to it. Right. Click the link and it'll take you to an abstract and you can read, you know, yourself about this study and your own decision. Agreed. I think like, that's my takeaway is be your own health advocate. Read the labels of the things you're eating and putting in your body. Yeah. Do the research, read the studies and decide what works for you and try it out. Yeah. It's not like the end, I'll be all you know, I have to stick to it for life. No. And I mean, I think most of the, um, most of the diets that are around these days are for a prescribed period of time. Yeah. Very difficult. There's like a boot camp, like, kind of version at the beginning. Yeah. And then it becomes easier and easier and you reach like some sort of level of general maintenance. But I think from doing any diet like that for a couple of weeks, even, one of the great things that you get from it is that you learn about your food, whether you want to or not, right? Because just by preparing your own food, planning your own, your meals every day, rather than just like going down to the cafeteria or going to like a fast food place and just buying something, like your force to get to know the food you're eating. Yeah. Like you know how many carbs are in celery. Right. You know, like how much fat is in like this, um, this, you know, five ounce steak. Right. Like you just know these things. And that in and of itself is something that makes you better off, just for having done it. Yeah. I think the ill health comes from a from not planning and resorting to what's around you. Because what's around you and easy is usually not good for you. Right. So you got to put a little, a little effort into it. Yeah. I did find this and I'm pooping it right off the bat, but US news and we'll report did a evaluated and ranked 32 diets from a panel of experts to be toprated a diet had to be relatively easy to follow nutritious safe and effective for weight loss and against diabetes and heart disease. So according to the experts, uh, these are the top 10 diets. And by the way, the paleo diet was 32 out of 32. Wow. They had it dead last. Wow. Uh, the dash diet is number one. Uh, and I'm not going to get into what all these are. You can look it up if you're interested. But the dash diet came in at one. The TLC diet is number two and that is not the TLC network. Okay. It stands for something. Uh, the Mayo Clinic diet, the Mediterranean diet and weight watchers all tied at number three. And then at number six, something called the flexitarian diet, which I never heard of. Uh, also tied at six was volume metrics. Number that sounds like it does. Uh, number eight was Jenny Craig. Uh, number nine was the biggest loser diet apparently to have their own diet. Uh, that's surprising. And number 10 was the Ornish diet. OR and I S H. And, uh, man, that this, it's a big industry. If you want to write diet books. Yeah, trying to get people going on good health. Right diet books start making like convenience food that falls within the diet. Yeah. That's a money. But uh, so what's our advice? Be your own health advocate. Try to avoid package foods and uh, and uh, put some time into it. That's right. How's that? We should write a book. That's good stuff. If you want to know more about the Paleo diet too, you can, um, look them up online at PaleoDiet.com. Uh, and yeah, just start looking around. If once you start poking into that kind of stuff, yeah, like it, it's almost like a great entree into the world of like understanding your own nutrition. It's empowering. Yes. Uh, and if you want to learn more about the Paleo diet, you can type those words into the search part. How stuff works.com. And since I said that, it's time for listen or mail. I'm going to call this defending scanner. Uh, I hate getting my name is, and I don't know how to pronounce it. It's H.A. I.K.E. Any idea? Hikie. Hikie. H. What? H.A. I.K.E. This is for Hikie. Hikie. Maybe. All right. I'm going to go with Hikie. Uh, hi guys. My name is Hikie. And I'm an Austrian psychology student. Um, I just wanted to defend poor BF scanner in case no one else did it yet. Uh, and the Anneja episode you mentioned, how Skinner's daughter should be honored because she was tortured in a box. Well, all Skinner ever put in the Skinner box where rats and pigeons, the thing he invented for his daughter was called the air crib. Uh, it is a crib that is higher than the average crib, so it's easier to stupover. Uh, and in it, there was a controlled climate for the infant. Fresh clean air was coming in from the outside and temperature as well as humidity could be controlled. Oh. Sounds like a box to me. It was just a device designed to make the baby's life more comfortable in the parent's life a little, uh, a little easier. Uh, Deborah Skinner is fine and untraumatized and she herself says that people should stop talking rubbish about her dad and her, uh, so maybe I can help. Help her out with this email. She owes you. She does. I keep up the good work guys. Um, my boyfriend is also a fan. Oh, so I hate his is a lady. Not necessarily. Oh, yeah. Let's check it out. I'm a caveman. Eat meat and nuts. That is very unlike me too. Oh, God, boyfriends got to be a girl. Right? I went also. I wanted to point out an error I made in when I was talking about how I wanted to punch Jared with the, uh, toxic bread of subway. Oh, yeah. You heard about it for that. Well, in my defense, all the, uh, it turns out that is not true, but all that stuff came out after we recorded. Like that was, had just hit the news the day we recorded and then all the other stuff saying now, it's just one lady who had a bundle pick and she was wrong that came out afterwards. So, uh, subway does not do that in a stolen punch Jared. Okay. I hope Jared doesn't listen to this. Uh, I feel so bad if he came up with a few days like me and I really am a big fan. Yeah, a video con. Oh, I'd hug him. Uh, yeah. I will look forward to that. I'll get a video of that and post that. If you want to get in touch with me and Chuck and point out how we were wrong or how we can better ourselves. Is that kind of thing? Oh, and thank you, by the way, what do we end up on hiker hake?
