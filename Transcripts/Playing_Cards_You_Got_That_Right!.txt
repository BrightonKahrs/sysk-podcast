Welcome to Stuff You Should Know, a production of I Heart Radio. Hey and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh and there's Chuck and Jerry's here too, so that makes this a rough and tumble, root and tutan episode of Stuff You Should Know. How you doing? I'm great. How are you? Pretty good you just celebrated a birthday just 24 hours ago. And that did. Happy birthday Chuck. Thanks man. How you feel? Good. You're great at feeling. I'm tired today, but not because of birthdays. I'm just. I'm tired today. Do you remember the time back years back when you would be tired because of your birthday? If right. Exactly. It's like the day after. Right exactly. Now you're just tired because you're a full year older. Yeah. I was tired before my birthday too. But we're not talking about being tired or birthdays Chuck. We were talking about playing cards. Yeah. This one, Dave Russel, this is Chuck Full of fun little nuggets that I think next time you're playing cards with people. You can just kind of pepper these in. Yeah. And they'll love you for it. They'll give us another one. Yeah. This is one of those. It just has lots and lots and lots of little fun factoids. And yes, I said factoids. Yeah. Yeah. They're 10% of a fact. That's right. So, what do you want to get that? There are a couple people well on the argument page. I'm sure. So Chuck, we talked a lot about playing cards before in our caro episode. Yeah. And one of the things we talked about was that it's a myth that playing cards developed from Tarot, which is what I had always thought too. I don't remember if I said that on the tarot episode. It was quite the opposite in playing cards were around long before Tarot cards were, even though they are related. Tarot cards were originally invented as new trump cards basically. And then they kind of evolved into the card of mancene and all that stuff. And just took off from there and went on their own path. But playing cards themselves are much, much older. And there's a lot of debate about exactly where the first playing cards were developed. And a lot of people say China, obviously China invented a bunch of stuff. And it's possible China did invent playing cards. But they seem to have possibly invented them in isolation. And they may or may not have influenced the playing cards that we trace our lineage back to. Our playing cards today trace its lineage back to. Yeah. And they may not be as far as the original Chinese cards go as old as they think. Because some people point to this game called the Yezi Ge. Yeah. I'll go with that. Okay. Why easy I separate word GE called the Chinese leaf game. And this was like 9th century CE Tang Dynasty time. And for a long time people I think were like, well, the leaves and the leaf game were pieces of paper and probably cards. But then more scrutiny has landed on. Now maybe the leaves were just like a rule book or a log book that you wrote stuff down because it was really a dice throwing game. Right. Or it could have been more like dominoes in the cards are used in that way, but not used like actual playing cards. But we do think we know pretty sure that the Chinese eventually did get their playing cards in isolation in the 13th century. I mean, I mean, pretty close to when Europe got them. Yeah. So 1294 is the first unambiguous reference to an actual what we call playing cards in China. Europe, they showed up in 1365. So that is a really, really short amount of time for China to have influenced Europe. So that's not where European cards came from. Instead, European cards came from the Mamluk Empire, which I believe we also talked about in the terror episode too, right? I think so in Egypt. Yeah. And it's interesting, like these cards came about because of, or they got popularized, I guess, because of trick-taking games. Like not the exact games we played today, like Yucca and Spades and Hearts. And I think bridges and other one. But kind of a similar thing where you have, you know, a suit that takes the hand, AKA the trick. Right. And there's usually a Trump card or a Trump suit. And these were like among the very first card games. And apparently in medieval times, they were wild for this game. Yeah. These kinds of games. They went so nuts that some officials were like, you have to stop playing that. We're going to actually ban it. You don't, we don't get it. And you guys are into it. So we're going to say you can't do that anymore. Right. But those mom-loop cards from Egypt were pretty similar to what we have today, right? Yeah. So there's 52 in a deck, which is we have today. Four suits. Check. 13 cards per suit. The... Yes. What we have. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Because, yeah. So, that's right. So, yes. 13 times four is 52. Well, I think where I'm getting mixed up is they had a number one card. But they did not have a queen. Is that the swap? Correct. Okay. So, yeah. They had a one card one through ten. And then they had cortisine cards, which we call court cards or face cards today. Mm-hmm. But like you said, they didn't have a queen. The queen was introduced until the French in the I think the 15th century. So, now we need to feminize this a little bit. And much for the better. But back in the Arab world, they were like, now we're not doing that. This is the 12th 13th century. We're just going to go with the Malik, the king. Mm-hmm. The Malik, which would be the king's like right hand man. Sure. The Thani Nayeb, which would be the king's right hand man, right hand man. The second 80. Yes. And that was it. Those were the... In addition to one through ten, those were your 13 cards in each suit. And the suits themselves. The cards had a lot of similarities to what we think of today. Like they had pips. Each suit was represented by a symbol that's called a pip. And we're new that. I knew that somewhere in the back of my head. I'm not sure why. But if you looked at one of these cards, one of these very ancient mom loop deck cards, there would be say like 13 or say eight pips on one card. That's the eight of say cups. If there were eight cups of it. Just like tonight, if there's eight little spades on there, that's the eight of spades. I mean, this is... It follows in a really old tradition. I guess is what I'm trying to say in a really, really clumsy way. Well, the difference is they didn't write a number eight. They just had eight of the pip's pictured to represent that number. And we still have that. We just added the number as well. Exactly. We've got both. Yes. And we'll get to there. Because it's I think the history of how these things sort of change from country to country is they became the leading manufacturers is pretty interesting. It really is. Let's say we'll take over from here every century or so. Yeah. And I think it looks like as far as Europe goes to Spanish and the Italians with the first to start. Manufacturing and using playing cards. They were called art called Latin decks. And they had as therefore suits. The cups, the coins, the swords and the clubs. But instead of... I don't think we mentioned that Apollo stick was the club. And the mom-loop cards. Spain said, what the heck is Apollo? Mm-hmm. Our clubs look like something. You beat someone up at the head with. So that's what we're going to go with. Yeah, they look like real captain caveman type stuff. Yeah, it's going to cool. So the Spanish being among the first to start adopting these decks is pretty appropriate because they were under rule by the moops or they had been for, you know, just a few centuries before. So they were in a lot of contact with their Muslim neighbors. So for that to be imported to Spain and then probably trickle over to Italy. That makes a lot of sense. And so that's kind of reflected in what the Spanish word for playing cards is. Now you pace. N-A-I-P-E-S. And the Arabic name for playing cards is N-E-B. And a apostrophe I-B. So very clearly descended from it. And that's one of the things that really fascinates me about playing card history is, like, yes, there's neat, like, symbolism and weird stuff going on. But it's all explicable. And it all follows like in this neat tradition that was built upon and changed, but really still kind of kept like the general guard brails that it was originally set up with. Yeah, and the changes are like kind of fairly minor. And they usually have to do with whatever made the most sense in that country, for instance, Spain, not knowing what a polo club was. Right, but they're like, you can hit somebody over the head with that. So we'll replace it with the club. Yeah, we'll use this matcher. Right. And there are some speculation and theories about what these initial, and this is in the medieval society, what these for suits represented. But one of the theories that kind of makes sense, I think, is that the sword was for the military or the nobles, the cup, for the clergy, the coin for the merchants makes sense. And the club for the peasants. And then in Europe, we moved to Germany. They kind of took over in the 15th century as making as being, I guess, champion card makers. Sure. And they replaced the cup with a heart, just getting a little more like we know it now. Yeah. The club was replaced by an acorn, which is a type of mast. That's the sword becomes a leaf. But if you look at it, it's sort of the similar shape as what we would know as a spade. Yeah, it's like a Ivy leaf almost. Yeah. And then the coin, because they were nuts about falconry in 15th century Germany in falcons, had bells attached to the Hawks in falcons, I guess. One of the called Hawkery. I think falcons take the cake in falconry. In the Hawks, please take a fiddle to it. They're like the thawney knife to the falcons. You know, the joke here in Atlanta that I use is whenever we see a Hawkery falcon. And we have both, obviously, as evidenced by our sports teams, Emily says, is that a Hawkery falcon, and I said, well, you'd know it's a falcon. If it flew into a tree, and then hit the ground. What does that mean? The reference to the Atlanta falcons. Oh, I see. Yeah. Like it was like, I'm flying so high. And then now, how did it anymore? Exactly. But I mean, doesn't the same apply to the Hawks, too? Yeah. I do the Hawks' never get off the ground. No. You could kind of interchange them. Yeah. But anyway, the falcons and Hawks had bells, and the coin on the German cards became a bell, because they were wild about falconry. Yeah. It's very cute. The Germans had definitely the most rustic pips of all time. I mean, an acorn. Come on. That's wonderful. So the Germans were going along. This is the 15th century. They dominated that as far as the card manufacturing went. And then the French took over in the 16th century. And Ruin, which is kind of in the northwest of France, became the playing card capital of Europe. And one of the reasons it became the playing card capital of Europe, as we'll see, is because they put out so many playing cards in their production and they were going to be so dramatically that it's just mind boggling. And as a result, the pips that the French adapted are the ones we still used today, even though we have different names. They were the ones who came up with the designs we used today. Yeah. So they were hearts and clover's self-explanatory. They had the diamonds, but their diamonds were represented a paving tiles called Carot. And the pike, which is the spear tip, I guess, is the spade. Right. Just the trend. Right. But they didn't call it a spade at the time. But they did a couple of key things, as far as what re-recognizes playing cards today, as they came up with the red and the black colors. Very big deal to differentiate that and make card tricks more fun. And then they, like you said, they manufactured a ton of them and they did this because they standardized the pips so that they could be stenciled on. And it was a lot cheaper and a lot faster than hand drawing or doing woodcuttings and hand painting these decks of cards, which was super expensive and time-consuming. Yes. And it made the cards, the deck of cards incredibly unattainable to the average person back in the, you know, up to the 16th century when the French took over. And what's the French took over and started producing these cards on mass? The card playing was just, it just took off like a rocket. People had already loved playing cards, but now more people could love playing cards. And it was because they figured out how to print these things, you know, more cheaply and more quickly. So that's why we use the French card today, just by virtue of the fact that they produced so many that it became like the dominant type of card in the world. And then the other reason I saw is that England eventually adopted the French card. And then kind of put their own twist on it, basically just renaming it. And then British colonialism is one reason why so many people around the world use the French deck today. So they took the French deck and spread it around the world. Yeah, and so the English, like you said, they sort of they use the same pip icons. I was about to say logo, but I guess are icons. And they just sort of changed the meaning. So the the clover, they went back to calling it the club, even though it's a clover when you look at it. So that's why you've you ever wondered why in the heck do they call that thing a club? That's why it's a it's a hat tip to the. Oh, geez, right. Exactly. Yeah, the spade looks like sort of the head of a spade type of shovel. But we think that the suit name actually probably and this makes a lot of sense is the anglicized version of espada, which means sword in Spanish, because sword was the original suit. And then the diamond they just called the diamond, but they said, you know what this has nothing to do with dumb paving tiles. Call it a diamond and as Dave so aptly puts a heart is just a heart. Is that an actual song or are you making up your own? That just made that up, but a bit to there's a song that goes a heart is just a heart. Well, you really you really do that in an actuality. Well, that didn't really count. It's usually more like. And by the way, we heard from a lot of listeners who do this. I know. Yeah, you're does a far from along. Yeah, I didn't think I was unique in any way, but it's um, it's usually like sung to the lyrics or sung to the tune of another song. Right. Like when you're a heart you're a heart all the way. Right. Like that. Exactly. I looked up that where that heart shape came from because if you think about it, our hearts don't really resemble that very much. Hmm. And like the human heart? Yes. And it's what it's said. I know. I cannot find the original source. There's a lot of debate over it, but it's centuries old and prior to it when it first started to emerge. The heart was kind of iconographified. Hmm. A agrifice? I don't know. I think you had it right. Okay. As of kind of a pine cone shape. Oh. Interesting. A little more accurate, but I like that the new heart icon, new meaning centuries old, but the most recent one. That mean there'd be very funny if it looked like the actual human heart. Yeah. You know the guy in Temple of Doom just pulls out like this heart emoji from the guys chest. Should we take a break? Ah, yes. I think we should. All right. We're going to take a break and get to those face cards right after this. Hi. I'm Kristen Bell.

They represented the royal court of course. And just like today back then, they were the champion cards, the most valuable on the deck. We'll get to the ace that was no ace card yet. And I think the story of the ace card is pretty cool anyway. So we'll say that. But these face cards were all men until like you mentioned before, the French introduced the Queen. And here to me is one of the first really fun facts of the episode that I love is for a long, long time. And I guess they know do it anymore, but in the UK and British India, they would follow what they call commonwealth rule or British rule, which is to say that the king and the queen can flip flop in which one is better in status, depending on who the monarch is at the time. So if you have a woman on the throne, then the queen is the top card just below the ace or until the ace was came along. Yeah, pretty neat. Pretty cool. Yeah, agreed. What something I didn't realize is that for many centuries, the kings, the queens and the jacks, which were at the time called the naves, were actually modeled on historical figures. Yeah. Like a charlaman was the king of heart, I believe, King David, the guy who killed Goliath. He was spades, Julius Caesar was diamonds and Alexander the Great was clubs. He had no idea, but if you look at a super old deck, and I'm guessing somewhere around probably up until the 19th century at some point, you could say, yeah, of course that charlaman, I'm drinking right so many way. Look at that beard on King David. He's juggling a rock. Yep. Do we should go through the queens in the jacks or just, to say, that they stood for people? No, I think we should. Give them a shout out. The queens were palace of Athena. Julius, Rachel, and Argin, which could be an anagram for Regina. That's, I said, all over the place. If you search Argin, the only thing that comes up is the card name. So there doesn't seem to have been a historical person named Argin. Yeah, this is one of those upon research that it's kind of like, it's difficult to corroborate some of this stuff, but you see the same facts everywhere, which a lot of times, you know, when we did our episode on how to research stuff, well, that can be a big red flag. Yeah. But maybe this is the case where it's not so much a red flag and just like, lower that people have just agreed upon. Yeah, because, you know, if it is, if there is a red flag attached to it, we usually turn it up eventually, and this one just didn't seem to have it. But yes, I'm with you. It's meld like it, but upon a much deeper smell. I was like, okay, this might actually work. Who was the jacks? The jacks were hector, who was the hero from the Greek city of Troy. At the end, the big gnolls, who was the hero of the hundred years war in France. Okay. Ojir, the dain, who was Charlemagne's knight. And either Judah Maccabee or Lancelot was the nave of clubs. And Judah Maccabee was from the Hanukkah story. Lancelot was one of King Arthur's memories. Yeah. Maccabee. So yeah, depending on the deck you had, it would basically, you would just new back in the day that if you're playing the King of Hearts, that was Charlemagne right there. It wasn't just this generic, weird-looking king. It was supposed to be somebody. Yeah. A brand name king. Exactly. And speaking of brand name kings, the god had talked about the suicide king. Definitely. That is the king that looks like he's stabbing himself in the head with a sword. That is the one, if you're looking at a modern deck of cards. That's the king of hearts. And that's the one that looks most different from the other kings in that he has four hands. And does not have the mustache, which is interesting. And like I said, it appears to be stabbing himself with a sword. For a long time, those are legend that's how Charlemagne took his life, but we know that's not true. Right. Because he died of pluracy. But what they now think is that the early French decks, Anglo-French decks, had a king of hearts with an axe above his head. And that just printing over time, the axe went kind of further and further down until behind his head such that you couldn't even see the axe blade. And so I guess that axe handle just became a sword looking like it was going into the king's head. Yeah. And now that you know, so like that axe was originally, it was like the king of hearts was captured in the backswing. Like he was about to chop somebody with his axe, right? Yeah. And now if you know that, you can see that the king of hearts is now just doing the same thing with the sword. He's in the backswing. Yeah. He's about to... Lob someone's head off. Right. But not his own. Yeah. Either one. The important point is someone's head is about to come off. They don't care whether it's lob or lob. Look at that. No mustache. Yeah. No stash. And one other thing. The king of diamonds now is the only one with an axe, which I never noticed before. I didn't either. I mean, you don't often, or at least I don't often sit around and look at a deck of cards. I play cards, but I never studied them because it's sort of one of those things. It's so ubiquitous in your life over the years. Right. That you don't really... It's interesting, might tie into our semantic association. Hmm. Short stuff coming up. Nice teeth. But let's talk about that ace card because it took a while for the ace... And it has a really neat story of how it happened. But it took a while for the ace to become the high card because when the ace eventually did come. It was the number one. And it was the lowest card. It was the worst card on the deck. Right. It was so lowly that they referred to it as an as, which was the least valuable coin in the Roman Empire. But then the French changed all that, right? Yeah. Which is... This is why the ace can sometimes be the highest card in the deck or serve as the number one card. Because if you ever... If you've never noticed before, the number card started too. You go through two through nine. Right? No. Two through ten. Yeah. Yes. Absolutely. I'm 100% certain. Two through ten. But this as the AS card. It was named after the least valuable coin in the Roman Empire. And it was kind of like a slang term to kind of just talk about how lowly the... That one card was. Then the French Revolution came along. And they kind of conceptually... Pitted the AS card against the court cards. They said, you know what? This is lowly one. We're going to make it top-al the court, the king, the queen, the jack. And now the ace is the top of the heap. This little lowly single card is now higher than any of the other ones. And then by the way, they also changed the king queen and jack to liverties, equalities, and fraternities. So they didn't... They weren't really into the king's and queens around the French Revolution very much. Yeah. And if you've ever wondered why the ace is the most sort of lavishly decorated card generally speaking. It's got a cool story behind that one too. So the British had a pretty interesting solution to taxing decks of cards, which was if you were a card maker, you had to... You couldn't print your own ace of spades. And so you had to get that from the government as an official, you know, card if the British empire. Right. And that was your tax. And they were as such. They were very highly decorated. They were uniquely stamped to try and prevent forgeries from happening. Right. And you couldn't, like as a card manufacturer, if you were to like, forget that. I'm not going to... We're just going to print our own ace of spades, and they'll never know. It would be hung or have your head locked off or lobbed off. You could be hanging to me. The penalty, what does it say, hung? Yeah. The penalty was death if you forged an ace of spades playing card. Yeah. There was a man named Richard Harding, which as far as I or anybody else can tell was, hanged for forging an ace of spades. And that nuts? Yeah. That is crazy to think about. And a weird... I guess it sounds like a weird way to pull off a tax, but it's also sort of brilliant. Yeah. But I mean, that's why so each company had their own design. And it was a lavish design, and that's why still today the ace of spades just stands out as the most lavishly design card. There was one other thing about that too, while they were during that period. I think in the early 19th century to the mid 19th century, the name for those ace of spades was old frizzle. Old frizzle. Yeah. I found that on a website, there was a post about the evolution of the history of the evolution of playing cards written by a game reviewer named Ender's game. And I thought it was going to be Snoop Dogg. No. No. But it does have a definite Snoop quality too, it doesn't matter. Yeah. It's kind of fun. If you've ever, you know, bicycle playing cards are very popular brand. I prefer the aviation poker cards personally. Okay. But I like a good bicycle deck. If you've ever looked at the ace of spades, you might see the number 808 on there. And there's long been speculation that there was some sort of cryptic meaning behind what the 808 is. And apparently it's just a model number because they had earlier decks that were 6 o 6s. So there's no like kind of fun hidden meaning to that. No. In bicycle is not its own company. It's actually the eighth edition of the US playing card companies designs. Right. It's the eighth design that came up with. So that's what that 808 is. And so you'll find that 808 on the ace of spades you said, right? Ace of spades, baby. So that ace of spades in particular, the bicycle aid ace of spades has a really storied history as far as world wars go. Apparently a war war two, the ace of spades was considered a lucky card. And so sometimes you'd see soldiers carrying the ace of spades around with them. Yeah, or you see, oh, you see it a lot in the tucked in the helmet in those war movies. Yes. And this is why most often you'll see it in the movies about the Vietnam War. There is a myth that was apparently considered correct at the time that the vehicle viewed the ace of spades as a symbol of death. The legend was that French cardimansers who had occupied the country previous to the war had had basically introduced them to the ace of spades as a doom card and that the vehicle were just scared to death of it. That's the legend. But that's not true. From what I saw, it seems to not necessarily be true. What? Now we're coming into the true part. There were a couple of Lieutenant, I believe, in Charlie company who wrote into the bicycle to the US playing card company, makers of bicycle cards, and explain this. And said, could we just get decks of nothing but the ace of spades? And US playing card companies said you got it. And they for the war effort. They actually did produce decks of nothing but ace of spades for US soldiers to use to scare and intimidate the vehicle. Yeah. And they were called the bicycle trademarked brand, the bicycle secret weapon. And apparently they would, they would drop these cards throughout the villages and the jungles and stuff. Just to sort of, you know, freak them out or in those they may not have been. Yeah. But even if it didn't work as, you know, because the vehicle we're already primed to be afraid of the ace of spades, you would probably start to associate it with some bad stuff. If at any time you came upon like a, a fallen soldier of yours with the ace of spades on his chest, laying in the jungle, sure. Even if it had already had that connotation before, I'm sure it developed that connotation pretty quickly, just by use of it. Yeah. By the way, I came across one of my closet the other day and I came across my box of trading cards. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And I popped them out and kind of looked through them real quick. The one thing I forgot that I had in addition to all those Star Wars cards and it turns out I have a lot of Star Wars cards. And I looked in there apparently they're not valuable or not very valuable. But I had a bunch of Superman the movie trading cards. I remember those man. Yeah. They're, they're photographs from the movie, right? Yeah, yeah, just like little scene still, whatever. I remember that. And then also, even though I don't even remember necessarily being that into the show, I guess I watched it a little bit, but I also have some battlestar galactica cards, 80s version obviously. And then a fair amount of football in BA hockey, but mostly baseball cards. Right. Did I think are all basically worthless? You just jog my memory. I remember now that they had Rambo trading cards for a little while. Oh, I would have loved to have had those. So kind of guess it was three. Where he's like shirtless and shooting like rockets at people. I mean, I was a first blood guy. And then the Rambo's got a little more ridiculous with each one. You could say. But I stand by first blood as being a really great movie. Yeah. It is. It's a good movie, but it's a different genre than the other. Yeah. Yeah. I'll do have to say that first blood never produced the greatest chewing gum of all time. Second greatest chewing gum of all time. Rambo chewing gum, which was blackberry flavored big league chew. Oh, my god. It was good. And it was second only to lemon lime bubble yum. The kind that was green on the outside with the yellow center. Yeah. I love that stuff. There's a pack for sale on eBay and everyone's so while I'm like, what it still work. Could I still chew it? Should I buy that? Look at toothbreaker. Yeah, probably, but me and that be amazing. Did the Big League chew have a little caricature of Rambo on it? It had like a movie still of him shirtless with the rocket launcher shooting it at somebody. And like a big fire explosion in the background. That rock at long-term. Yeah. And you'd just put the whole pack in your cheek and be like somebody can give me a rocket launcher. It's amazing how many products they marketed it at a Sony tobacco products. Oh, yeah. I used to do. Remember beef jerky chew. It was like a can of dip, but it was shredded beef jerky. Love that stuff. The gum cigarettes that you could puff on. They still have those. That's all those recently. Do they really? And I was like, what? They still make these in my local convenience store. Wow, that's very surprising. Yeah, it was pretty funny. What about those pink gum cigars? I don't remember those. They were just a long stick of gum in the shape of a cigar and then it had like a cigar band wrapper on it and they tasted awful. It was the most awful gum there was worse than like the sticks that you would get in old baseball card packs. But it was just a different taste and it was not good gum. But they were still fun to like, you know, pretend you were up and coming to smoke or would. I wonder if there's a candy cane blunt or something like that. I suddenly realized why I started smoking at age 14. I was kind of primed to do that. Also, before we break, I know we're tangenting on tangents, but I meant to clear up when I told that story about Emily getting a note from her mom to buy cigarettes at the store. Yeah. She was like six years old. This wasn't a teenage thing because you were like, yeah, bottom when I was 10 or 11. Right. She was younger than my daughter and just the thought of her going into a store at that age, a child and getting cigarettes because you had noticed it doesn't get any more 70s in that. Well, not just that. It's very Ohio too. Yeah. So much so I'm going to clean a new term that's so high. Okay. Yeah. I like to use that for now on. All right. Well, let's reel it in. Take a break and we'll come back and talk about the Joker or the Joker. All right. Right after this. I'm Christian Bell. Getting help from my anxiety made me feel like myself again, but we have all sorts of reasons for putting off taking care of ourselves. I thought I could just keep pushing through my depression symptoms. Let's push through dinner with the in-laws, not life. I don't want medication to change who I am. Understood. But what if it helps you feel like yourself again? I hope my depression would just go away after a while. Same. But for me, it was kind of like wishing away my taxes.

OK, Chuck, you really teased it up right before this ad break. We're going to talk about you, Kerr. And which is where the Joker came from. You play you, Kerr? Yeah, we've talked about it on the show. Oh, that's right. My Ohio Relatives introduced me to it. And I had to get it re-explained every Christmas because I could just could never remember the rules. Right. Yucca is very so high, oh. Yes, it's so high, oh. But Yucca came from the Al-Sace region of Germany. And it was originally called Yucca-Speel. OK. Yeah, with the JUCK. Yes, JUCK-E-R-Speel. Whereas what's the Yucca card game? How's that spelled that we play? Today it spelled you, or sorry, you see HRE-Uker. And then Dave points out like Yucca-Riste. And I think he was trying to trigger in us a mention that he's the host of the hit podcast Biblical Time Machine. Why I think he put that in there. Lizette, what it was. OK. Although there's not many words out there that are like the word Yucca. But we, we'd like and nice to it, right? From JUCK-E-R to E-U-C-H-R-E. But originally that JUCK-E-R In America people started calling it JUCK-E with the hard J like the J pronounced not like a Y. And then that very quickly became JUCK-E, which was a card that was designed expressly for the game of JUCK-E, right? That's right. The Jolly JUCK-E who has always been sort of a sort of a court gesture-eamp like person. And they think that that's a reference to that the JUCK-E in Yucca was a trickster who took the tricks of the game. Because it was the super Trump card. Yeah, exactly. Like the number one Trump card and we're not going to go over Yucca, but it's all about the Trump cards and descending value of the power and the left power. Right. And then the Uber card, which is the JUCK-E or the JUCK-E. And they call those original Trump cards the right and left power, or the OWER, like they're in the act of bowing. But that's actually a bastardization of the German power, B-A-U-E-R, which means farmer in German. Mm, like Jack Bower. Yeah, so it's really interesting to see how just completely mixed up things can get. Yeah. When you just change the spelling of a word and even pronounce it the same, but just change the spelling here there and all of a sudden, you have just completely lost its original meaning and adopted a new one. I find that fascinating. But anyway, to sum this up, the Joker was created to become the best power, the Imperial power, and then over time, because it was associated expressly with Yucca, JUCK-E, it became the Joker. That's right. And we're going to finish up with some fun poker facts slash Las Vegas facts. Yeah. Here's one. Barry Manel has his own blackjack tables. We've seen them with our own eyes. Didn't play on them because I didn't want to desecrate it by losing on a very manel on a table. But playing cards in gambling obviously is, you know, people started gambling with playing cards a long long time ago. And when it comes to poker or really any kind of card game you're gambling with, they wanted to understandably not have their cards be seen by other people. These sort of gigantic icons of suits and these bigger fonts and things like that wasn't working out. So for poker cards, they introduced a few few little changes to make this more possible to hold your hand tighter together. And that is called the squeezer card, which was, you know, the first cards to have a very small symbol at the top left corner, indicating the number and the the pit or the suit. And so that means that's why you see a poker player holding that really tight hand. All you need is that let-hand corner barely exposed. Yeah. And those little, the little, the, the pip with the number or the letter of the face card, it's called an industry. Those are indices. And before them, the reason why it makes so much sense in poker like you're saying, you used to have to spread your cards out wide to say like, oh, there's nine pips on here. This is a nine of clubs. And now it was just kind of marked in the corner, which is great because you're not sharing your hand with the other people. There was another way you could give away what kind of cards you had in old style cards. And that the, the face cards, the court cards were printed one direction. There was one direction that was up and one direction that was down. Not like today where they're both upper down. It doesn't matter which way it's dealt. Before you would have had to have taken that court card and flipped it around. If it was dealt to you upside down and you would have just told everybody at the table, I have at least one face card in here. Yeah, what total give. And think about the mom looks. They had to sit there and out loud go. One, two, three, four, five, six. And they would have to count those pips in every corner. Now you have a six of something. Right, but that's what the poker players had to do too. But like, until you had the squeezer cards. I thought they had the number on there. They just had a bigger number. I don't have the number at all. No, I don't think they had the number at all until the, the squeezer, the indices cards were introduced. And there's one other thing about it too. Why would they do that? Because other decks of playing cards had numbers on them. Why didn't they just use those? Like prior to the 19th century? No, just prior to the squeezer card. They did. So the squeezer card came out in the 19th century. What I'm saying? Oh, have they been around for that long? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes. And that's the first time that the actual number was printed. Yes, before you would just have nine hearts on there. There you go. I thought they just did it super small. No, they put it super small like out of the gate. But that was to, to, to, so you wouldn't have to spread your cards out and see what you were dealing with. You see what I'm saying? I got you. Sure. The other thing that was changed with the indices Chuck was, remember I said that the jacks used to be called naves. Mm-hmm. And a nave is like an assistant to the royal family basically or a knight or something like that. And it spelled like knight k n a v e. Well, now that you have the indices and you have a k q or j. If you had a k q or k n, which is how they initially abbreviated nave, if you didn't spread your card far enough, you might think you had a king, but in fact, you had a jack. And they actually changed nave to jack because of those indices at the top. Yeah. And they also used to be white on the back. They didn't even have fancy decorations. That's right. And you know, if you have a, it's very easy to mark a white card with some, some other something or it might just accidentally give, get a smudger or stain or something. Sure. You're in Doritos at a poker game. That can get everywhere. And then you know, of course, the Dorito card is the Ace of Spades or whatever. Right. And apparently the Thomas De La Rue and company was a British printer. He was first credited with those beautiful lithographic designs on the back and the early 19th century. And I did mention Vegas. You're right. If you dug this stuff up, it was kind of fine. If you wonder how much they switch decks of cards in Vegas. If it's going wild and crazy, they might switch a deck of cards every hour. Yeah. For that same reason, they don't want them to get marked so that somebody would have an advantage by noticing that there's like a fray on the Ace of Spades, you know, right corner or something. Yeah. The most that they use them for is 12 hours, right? Yeah. I mean, that's, that's it. The Barryman. It's painful. It wasn't getting much action. There was another thing to that. A lot of people point out that we have no idea whether it was purposeful or not. But it's pretty astounding if it's coincident, right? About the whole the seasons in the year and the months and all that. Yeah. Fifty two cards, right? Fifty two weeks. Yes. The two colors are they night and day. Yes. Do those four seats represent the four seasons perhaps? Correct. And then what's the last? Just knock them down here. There's 12 court cards. There's 12 months in the year. There's 13 cards in each suit and there's 13 full moons in a year. The one that, so up to this point, you're like, wow, that's pretty amazing. This is the one that gets me. If you count every single pip on all 52 cards and add them together, there are 365 of them. What? Yeah. And that neat. That's good stuff. I agree. And there's a pretty cute TED Talk by a guy named Marco Tempest from several years back where he explains all this while doing pretty neat card tricks. It's a good one. You can find it on YouTube. All right. You got anything else about cards? I got nothing else about cards. We've done tarot cards, trading cards, playing cards. I guess greeting cards is next. No. Yeah. We could do one on the the hallmark company. Maybe they'll sponsor it. Oh, that's a great idea. We'll talk to AdCales about that one. Yeah. Well, while we're off talking to AdCales, what will hold off on that? And instead do a listen to your mail first. I'm going to call this just to follow up as I was talking about people making up their own songs. We heard from quite a few listeners. It seems like mostly board dads to do the same thing this I do. This is from who is this from this from Jeff. He said, hey guys, at the very beginning of the episode, Chuck D.T. Also, he makes up songs like that's a maro. My eyes lit up because dude, I do the exact same thing. Maybe it's a common thing that most people do and they're too embarrassed to admit to. But I've never met anyone else who claims they do it. One example from last night, I'm particularly proud of was I was making my three year old daughter dinner. Grab the box of Annie's macaroni and cheese. Shout out to Annie's. And almost involuntary the words involuntarily the words throughout of my mouth. And I'll go ahead and sing it in the tune of night's and night's at me. Okay. Shows and white cheddar. My crew wave is your friend. I don't know what's better when there's not much to spend. It's pretty good stuff. Yeah, that was really good. I also had a little social commentary at the end too. Yeah, that's from Jeff with a G. Because it's Annie's brand, I always expect him to say something like, It's a Mac and cheese. And I for us. You know what I mean? Uh-huh. Wow, I'm getting on that train too. Chuck, it isn't toxicating, isn't it? It is. It's a good thing. Well, if you want to be like Jeff Jeff and tell us about some amazing song you came up with.
