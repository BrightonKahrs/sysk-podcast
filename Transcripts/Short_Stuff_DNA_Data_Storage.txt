 You know, there are some things in life you just can't trust. Like a free couch on the side of the road. Or the sushi rolls from your local gas station. Or when your kid says they don't need the bathroom before the road trip. But there are some things in life you can't trust. Like the HP Smart Tank Printer. With up to two years of ink included and outstanding print quality, you can rely on the HP Smart Tank Printer from HP. America's most trusted printer brand. Hey, and welcome to the short stuff. I'm Josh and there's Chuck and Jerry's here too. And so it's Dave and Spirit and we're coming at you from the future of right now. This is one of those where it's so interesting, so cool, so mind blowing and so promising. And then you get to the very end. And then you're like, oh. To me, that just meant just give it a little more time. No, and a lot of times that is the case. And probably we'll be in this case, but it was such a, oh. And you'll see what in about, you know, 12ish minutes, what we're talking about. So essentially what we're talking about first is data. We've got a lot of data. Like anytime somebody says something, think something, write something down. Somebody comes up with a new recipe or a new patent or whatever. That gets encoded. It's data that gets saved. We don't really throw stuff away anymore. And so we're kind of a wash in data. And if you want to take that day and you want to save it, you want to preserve it. Let's say it's really important, like you're the library of Congress. Sure. Get this, man. I did not realize this. What you do is you take that data and you transfer it onto the same kind of magnetic Reels that those old room size computer mainframes used to read and write data. You put it on tape. Yeah, exactly. I didn't realize that, but it's just the proven go to mean. To mean of long term, it's called archival storage of the kind of data that you don't really need to access any time soon. It's called low touch data. You're just putting it literally in cold storage. Yeah, I mean, it's been around for a long time. Very dependable, very durable, very reliable. It's it doesn't cost a lot of money. It can hold a ton of data. One tape can hold between one million and 15 million gigabytes. Or one to 15 petabytes. That's a lot of stuff. And there, the problem is, you know, it's all relative, but they're kind of big, but not big, big. They're three inches by three inches and you're like, and check that's not very big at all. But that is big when you talk about, you know, potentially billions of these things and having to store them in a place that is, like you said, cold storage. So it's the cost of building these cold storage buildings that is the issue when it comes to this three by three inch thing. That and then also, you know, they've been around for three quarters of a century. So we know they last that long if you keep them in cold storage, but we don't know exactly how long they will last. So there's also a question of that. So that combined with so cost, questions about how long it will last. And then also just the enormous amounts of information we're adding every year. And we're making people look for other ways to encapsulate data to encode data in ways that are cheaper, that are smaller, that are require less money to keep cold. And what they've come up with Chuck for anybody who has looked at the title of this episode, they won't be very surprised. But DNA. I'm trying to know it's early, but we gotta take a break right there, right? I agree. All right, we'll be right back. Bachelor Nation, can we steal you for a second? Bachelor happy hour, the one and only official Bachelor Nation podcast is back. Go behind the scenes with your host, Bachelor in Paradise season seven new leweds, Joe and mobly and Serena Pit.

On the best podcast ever with Raven and Miranda, you'll hear, well, the best podcast ever. Join Raven Simone and her partner Miranda Mayday as they let the wheel of words determine the topic of that week's show. Every episode will spin a wheel of random words from things like animosity to something like Zodiac and whatever it lands on. That's what we're going to talk about for around an hour. Think we can't do it? Well, then you've never heard of stuff. Each week, Raven and Miranda and celebrity guests like Demi Lovato, Kiki Palmer and Megan Trainer will spin the face. We'll spin the face wheel and then the conversation will begin. Also, we're going to have a ton of amazing guests because you don't want to just hear us to all the time. Do you? Yes, you do. And somehow we're going to start with something like spider and end with, well, when was your last name for breakdown? Listen to the best podcast ever with Raven and Miranda. On the iHart Radio app, Apple Podcasts, or wherever you get your podcasts. All right. So you dropped a pretty big truth bomb on everyone. I'm sure there are people that for 60 seconds were like, what? Storing data on DNA, dude, that's in my body. Like, what are you talking about? Put in data in my body? You got that straight. You don't have that straight, but here's a pretty good, as far as how much this stuff can hold. This is pretty staggering stuff. And this is from a couple of dudes from the Los Alamos National Lab, and I think you got it from Scientific American. Here's how much DNA can hold. 74 million bytes of information, which is basically the Library of Congress. That's a lot. You can put that if you were putting it on DNA into the size of something as big as a poppy seed. 6,000 times over. Right. Said another way, if you split that seed in half, you could store all of the data on Facebook. Yeah. And then by 2025, the size of the data that humanity's generated will reach an estimated 33 zeta bytes. So the 3.3 followed by 22 zeros of bytes of information. A lot of bytes. If you can transcribe that all into DNA, you could fit the whole thing into a ping pong ball. Yeah. Not a 3 by 3 plastic cartridge multiple times over. A single ping pong ball could hold all of the world's data, and you can make multiple ping pong balls as backups too. Yeah. And you don't need to, and it's pretty easy to duplicate them apparently. And you don't need to keep them in the fridge, even though you could put it in an egg carton. Sure. And be set. You don't even have to. It's going to last a long time, not being in cold storage and probably even longer in cold storage. You could give a ping pong ball to every living human to keep in their fridge. And it would have no problem whatsoever. Be like here. You keep this cold for 150 years. And only half of them would eat that ping pong ball thinking it was an egg. Yeah. Yeah. So you'd still be left with all those backups. Here's where it gets super interesting though, because, you know, it's most people listening probably are like I said, as I was reading this, I was like, okay, that's a cool idea, but like how in the world does this work. And it turns out that it's not that mind blowing your difficult. And that's ain't I could go out and do it. But it makes a lot of sense to wrap your head around because DNA as we all know is composed of four nucleotides or at least combinations of guanine, thymine, adenine and cytosine, just remember GTAC and Matica. Yeah. Oh, ironically. All this digital data though is included that's out there in the world and as everyone knows in ones and zeros. So it's, it sounds like, you know, and it can be any combination of ways, but when you really break it down, it's really you can either just have zero zero zero one, one zero or one one, as far as those combination scale. And that's four things. And there are those four nucleotides. So if you just like say, hey, each one of these nucleotides is going to be assigned a different number, then that's all you need. There's, there's the key to your map. Yes, so say, adenine's, stands for zero zero and guanine stands for one one and so forth. Each one stands for one of those pairs of possible combinations. Then you can take any string of binary data, zeros and ones and turn it into genetic code based on those nucleotides. So like, you would just have, you go from a string of ones and zeros to a string of ATGs and C's. That's it. The thing is, is you're not, you're not turning ones and zeros into letters. You're actually transcribing the ones and zeros from binary code into physical genetic material. You're actually putting a base of adenine's scene right there. You're putting a base of thymine next to it. Like depending on how the code reads, but the ones and the zeros and what order they're in, you're actually physically creating genetic material, DNA, but rather than encoding the information to building a living thing, you're encoding the information to the entire catalog of stuff you should know. And honestly, isn't that the first thing we should preserve in DNA? Sure. Good. After the movies of gene milder. How about at the same time as the movies of gene wilder? Can we just agree to that? How dare you? Hey, I think highly of us aging wilder. I don't know why he's been on my mind lately, but he has been. He's been shaking it for you in your head. He's been shaking it for me. So this all sounds great. And like I mentioned at the very beginning, this is one of the things we like Holy cow. This is the future. This is it. And then the, at the end. And the, is that it's really expensive to do this. Like we, we can do this. We figured out how to do this. It's possible. We have the tech to do this. But that, uh, here's a tape name, LT, O, Dash, 9. It's a magnetic storage tape. You can get it for eight bucks and you can get one pet a bite of storage. Mm-hmm. That would cost you about $1 trillion to do for DNA. Yeah, there was a guy who was interviewed in ours, technical named He and June Park. He's the CEO of a data storage company called catalog. And he even asked him and he said, let's say it cost you three cents to print a single nuclear tide. Yes, that's cheap. But for each base parrot, now you're up to six cents. And then you're now you're translating gigabytes. You're entering millions of dollars. So if it cost millions of dollars to, to translate a gigabyte, it's cost trillions of dollars to do a pet a bite. And the other problem of it, two chuck is that it's really, really slow, right? It's super slow. So this is a clear case of one of those things, like you mentioned, which is like just wait because like with any technology, it's going to get quicker. It's going to get cheaper. I don't know if this is like a hundred years in the future. But at this point, the cost is just so outrageous that there's no government is going to fund something like that. I mean, a trillion dollars for one pet a bite of information is not. You're not going to sell that very easily. And then yeah, like I was saying, the speed. If you're transferring information from one of those magnetic storage tapes, you're transferring it about a gigabyte per second, typically. If it takes even like a second to print a single nuclear tide, which is still as very fast, but we're thinking on human level fast. We need to think on like how many ones and zeros are in the average gigabyte of code. Now you're talking about decades to transfer a pet a bite, disks worth of information using DNA technology. Yeah. So yes, it's very slow right now. It's very expensive right now. But I don't think we're 100 years off chuck because we're able to do this now, relatively cheaply because the human genome project came along. That was 20 years ago. Think about how far we've come. And this is like the hardest chunk the first 20 years. I think it's just going to get faster and easier. I don't think we're going to be waiting 100 years to see DNA data storage. Does that mean that stuff you should know is in the hardest chunk? We're in your 15. I think so. Yeah, it feels like it. Okay. I'm kidding. Well, I'm teasing Chuck, right? Yeah. Just teasing which means of course short stuff is out. Stuff you should know is a production of eye heart radio.
