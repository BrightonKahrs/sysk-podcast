Welcome to Stuff You Should Know, a production of I Heart Radio. Hey you all come to the podcast of Josh and there's Chuck and Jerry's here too. And this is Stuff You Should Know, as always. At the summer Chuck, I think we just broke our record for earliest edits. And then as you know, that came quick. You cleared your throat and we for some reason are cutting it out. Because it's not good stuff. Well, don't want to hear that do they? No, no, maybe we're going to. You're 15. We've established our unprofessional quality. It is true. Speaking of unprofessional qualities, you know, who is terrible. Some of these emphers. Very nice segue. Have you ever been to the Colosseum? You have, right? Yes, it's amazing. Did you go into it? Yes. I didn't go into it. I walked around it. And you know, this was my big European jaunt was when I was broke and backpacking. So like my friend and I did the best we could. But we did walk outside of a lot of structures that many other people pay to get into. You didn't have money for a pottery shard. No, we had no no to get in these places. But it's it's just a wonder to walk around. And I mean, that's what I love about Rome is just seeing. Yeah, seeing stuff that old is just really humbling and cool. Rome is one of the very few cities that I visited and been like I could totally live here. Oh, really. Yeah, it's a neat town for sure. And part of it is because there's been walking along and all of a sudden the wall is suddenly 3000 years old. You know, it's just like that kind of place. Like everything's just kind of built up on top of everything else. But stuff has been preserved or accidentally exposed. It's just a really neat town. I loved it for sure. Yeah, and boy, just how good looking as everybody. Yeah, those Italians, they know what they're doing when they really. Oh, man. I was like, oh, I'm in love with her and her and I might be gay. Look at that guy. They are they are a good looking bunch for sure. All of them are just so attractive like the on a Friday night at the Spanish steps is just like how many good looking dark, cared people can you get together in one spot. So I think like our most dedicated listeners know that you're just buttering up the Italians because you're going to be busted out some Italian accents. You don't want to be mad at you. Alright, so you're all avoiding them up. But, very nice. That's a good one. I don't know if that was nice or good, but I appreciate the kudos. Yeah, but we're talking Coliseum. Okay. And it's interesting to me how like, and you might have gotten all the stuff from the tour, but I was just kind of knocked out in this article, Livia put together of how, how sort of modern, like modern stadium going experience it felt like. Yeah, and actually there's there was one fact that stood out to me. I was like, well, they've got current stadiums beat. Um, day supposedly the packed cheek to jowl. Um, you could fit 87,000 people in there. And the whole place could be emptied or filled within 15 minutes because the circulation was that beautifully engineered. Yeah, I think that's a slightly dubious claim, but. Okay. Well, I bet it was quick and like nothing like it is today. And 18, and I'm not going any higher than that. Well, and back then you would, you know, you would just walk back to your place or take a mule or something like, you know, post, post traffic experiences near American stadiums or the stuff of the legend. It's awful. Yes, for sure. But marking decks. Oh, where's the thing ever invented? They're pretty bad. They're awful. Yes, it's true. And you know, it's going to get a lot worse. They're, um, developing that whole area that like kind of no man's laying. It's like old tree tracks and abandoned stuff in between. Um, stay farm arena and Mercedes Ben stadium. Yeah, oh, yeah, the Gulch. Yes, they're, they're developing that. So it's just going to get a million times worse down there. They should just set up helicopter service and drop people in. Well, I think what they're doing is trying to be like, hey, don't jump in your car. Just go hang out at a bar restaurant. Okay. Like there's going to be stuff to do there. Yeah. Because there's not right now. No, there's not much. Not a whole lot. There's some cool hotels down there, but they're kind of coming around a little bit. Yeah, for sure. So, but we're not talking about downtown in laying everybody. And I know your horses. We're talking about the call. See him like he said, um, that was just kind of one fact. And I'm calling it a fact. You're, um, I guess you're pooping in a little bit. It's just fine. We can agree to disagree on that. And I think you're probably right, but still, um, it is kind of underscores how everybody in History is looked back at the call of seam is just this marvel of engineering and a design and architecture. It was built in like eight years astoundingly enough. And it's survived earthquakes and all sorts of terrible catastrophes. And it's still standing in a watt pretty good shape considering how old it is. 2000 years. Um, but what I didn't know when I was there, I knew but it didn't really sink in. Mm-hmm. It is one of the most despicable places ever built in the history of Western symbolization. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we're going to get into the stuff that went on there. It's, uh, you know, it wasn't like the history of the globe theater or anything like that. You know? It was much bloodier because everyone knows, well, yes, the gladiators fought at the Colosseum. I've seen that Russell Crow movie true, but it was much, much worse than even that. And that was pretty bad. But like you said, we'll get into it. Let's talk about the actual Colosseum and where it came from first, how about that? Yeah. So, you know, those are long history of theaters, period in the world. Uh, the Colosseum certainly was not the first, but it was, uh, one of the first, you know, built in stone, concrete amphitheaters. And if you're confused, like I was, the term amphitheater, these days can, can just mean a, you know, a big concert, a venue. It doesn't have to necessarily mean it is just a round thing. Right. Because most things called an amphitheater day are the kind that were not, uh, like they wouldn't have used that turn back then. And because they weren't fully in circle. It's like it's a, it's a theater like the Hollywood bowl or something. You've got a stage and then the seats are sort of built in a big hill and a semi circle. Like those are called amphitheaters now, but technically amph, amphee means around. And so it was, these were the first theaters to, to be built all the way around, whatever performance was going on. Yeah, totally. And like today's amphitheaters are, um, much more like the old theaters. Yeah. Exactly what you describe it's like if you go to amphitheaters, you can understand what a theater was in grease and ancient Rome. Um, and back in the day, the, the Roman Senate decided that, um, having, um, these, these venues permanent, as permanent structures was decadent. So there was a ban on building permanent theaters and amphitheaters. Um, but that doesn't mean that the ones that they, they built, that were temporary weren't incredibly elaborate. Oh, sure. Nina seen plenty mentions one wooden temporary theater in in a row. I believe that had three stories of columns 3,000 Bronze statues. And um, they gave out Free Bible heads of Nehiro when you came. What's up with plenty all over the place the past few years? Like if you're a story and took especially of that era, your, you are so happy that that man lived because he sat down and said, You know what I'm gonna write all this down for posterity. I'm sure people who come later are gonna want to know what we were doing at this time and sure no because of planning I guess we just done more topics. I just feel like we went I mean he's the new fighter flight for us Yeah, yeah, totally So like we said there were stone amphitheaters the first one ever I believe was in Pompeii The very awesome infamous pink Floyd live-up Pompeii concert was in there. That's so good of nobody Which is a very cool strange thing to do and then finally we get We get narrow as Emperor and he was around during the great fire of 64 where a lot of the wooden stuff obviously went away including wooden amphitheaters and Rome and Nero was able to say like all right, you know, I'm gonna rebuild a lot of stuff and put my stamp on Rome But I'm not he didn't get around to building an amphitheater before he went away No, he didn't and it was a big deal that the amphitheater in Rome the temporary one was burned down because already gladiator battles had been firmly established in That in the popular culture so all of a sudden you had like people who couldn't go to like You know the local blood sport. Yeah event and like vene all of their frustrations and not you know stage and uprising against you as the emperor So it's something you would want to have but Because of that fire a lot of people still to the stay blame Nero for starting the fire because he rebuilt Yeah, such opulent monuments to himself on the rubble of Rome Anyway, he eventually was toppled by a coup the Di bisou aside and that left open a power vacuum that was filled within one year I think Rome had something like three Different no four different emperors because a little civil war started and the guy who emerged successfully was And the first emperor of the Flavian dynasty Vespasian Vespasian very nice Yeah, he and you know he took a look around he had a couple of kids a couple of sons notably Titus and I guess domain Tian I think so okay and he got them established as successors So he was pretty firmly rooted at this point and he was like you know Nero came in and tried to Well, not try to very successfully built a lot of monuments to himself Kind of put his own stamp on Rome like Chuck will mention earlier in the podcast many years from now And I want to put my stamp on this thing And so I'm gonna build my own sort of huge Colossus theater he didn't say that because we'll talk about where the name came from in a second But his son had been out You know Active as a military leader I believe it was Titus yeah for the siege of Jerusalem came back with a lot of war spoils and So basically you know I've got all this money now beside raising taxes and claiming public land and doing you know Basically whatever Vespacy and wanted as far as building Infrastructure and probably monuments to himself sure He said now I've got these war spoils so I can build like a proper Concrete permanent stone amphitheater. Yeah, the first one in Rome and Vespacy and was already pretty beloved he was a really popular general a successful general He was he was popular with the Senate so when he became a member of everybody was like okay, this is cool But he really won everybody over because Neuro had been taking all of Rome's money and spending it on monuments to himself and like this enormous Multi acre I think like a hundred and fifty acre house Called the Golden House and Vespacy into the opposite like yeah He built some monuments to himself but he also built a lot of public monuments and that's what the Colossus It was it was a gift to the citizens of Rome like remember that cruddy wooden temporary theater Remember how the Senate banned temporary theaters here is your first State of the art Permanent amphitheater that you are going to watch so many people murdered and it's going to just knock your socks off That's right, I did a very crass joke. They're gonna keep to myself Okay Because this is a family show but tell me later. I'll tell you later. All right, and he was so sort of Take this in era that he built the Colossus in on the site where that estate was We're near a lived Domus area. That's the Golden House. That's right. That was the land on which the Golden House sat and the Lake that was built there. There was this artificial pond so I can gonna fill that up even and really just sort of erase Inero's legacy as much as possible And can you tell him where the name Colossium may have come from apparently there was like a hundred something foot tall nude statue of Neuro And rather than um it was bronze and rather than melted down and reused it I they put it up and they Proped it up in front of the Colossium so that was the the amphitheater that had the Colossus of Neuro or the Colossium It's like museum but with Coloss Right, but they didn't pronounce it Colossium. No, they called it like the amphitheater Yeah, no one took Colossium until later no one's ever took Colossium except for me. Yeah, you're gonna really threw me off before we started All right, that's the way we take a break.

And with the ancient uh recipe for concrete was a funny enough I kind of looked that up because Roman concrete is very famous because it's still standing in modern concrete can crumble in a matter of decades right so Roman's kind of had a speed I may figure it out that it was because they mixed quicklime in at really high temperatures and it created this chemical reaction that was still kind of buzzing after the stuff was poured so that it would cheer much more quickly and solidly that's what they think it was. So just the heat they heated up that quick Greek the heat my god the heat uh if you love columns you would be delighted with the Colosseum because there's a lot of columns and they go in order from um lowly to I guess the most revered as they start with the Doric style at the bottom move on up to the ionic on the second level and then finally of course you get to the very fancy Corinthian columns on the top and they even had a little uh not a little pretty sizable retractable awning yeah that went all the way around it and um if you've ever been to the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta it sort of is like that where there's a circle in the ceiling and Atlanta of course that opens and shuts like a camera shutter would or I guess an old film camera shutter would sure so in Atlanta it has a circle around above like to where the field could possibly get reigned on of course they don't open it when it's gonna rain sure but uh all the humans are covered and that was the same deal as there was a circle in the center that always stayed open because you know they didn't have retractable roofs but they did have a retractable partial awning to keep everyone else dry yeah and then the the so the building was huge the actual like floor the ground that the action took place on the arena floor it was an oval shape of 272 by 157 the sandbox yeah it was covered in sand because it would soak up like blood and they needed it because a lot of blood was spilled there and like I said it took eight years to build and apparently it was finally um dedicated under emperor Titus Vespaisian son under his watch and he was actually a pretty short lived emperor although much beloved um and his little brother Domician yeah um when he became emperor she excavated that the arena floor about 10 20 c down yeah built the hypogium which means basement or below ground and it it was here where suddenly this thing became like this magical marvel of special effects and technical wizardry yeah totally this is where like you could really kick it up and not when you could have 600 dudes uh and a lot of you know most of these were slaves obviously um but they're down there all of a sudden with pulleys and ramps and trap doors and and pull the operated elevators and you could do all kinds of crazy magical things down there at at the least you've got a holding area for animals and gladiators and people and you know those sort of like you would think of any sort of backstage area of like a circus or something except it was underground. I think that they'd be treated in gladiator if I'm not mistaken but they they would have like there's a production company that builds a replica of this for a PBS documentary few years back and actually donated it to Italy so it's on display in the Coliseum but they showed how like you would put an animal on a cage you some pulleys to bring it up and as it was coming up toward the floor of the arena a trap door would open and then all of a sudden there's just a lion sitting there that was there before so I mean imagine watching like a man fight a lion to begin with before it was like here comes the lion walking in here comes the man walking in pohaum now it's like a lion magically appears and starts fighting with the guy this was like the kind of stuff that they were throwing at the citizens of roamed at the time and for money can tell almost all of the citizens of roamed were eating it up there were some people were like this is an awful barbaric place at the time but most citizens of roamed were super into it you know when I saw Bon Jovi in concert saw them a couple of times both by accident they opened up for 38 special when I was like in the eighth grade when they were that they were small band did you wake up like after having been drugged like a Bon Jovi concert now the second time was my senior year in high school sort of a long story but there was somebody at her school that couldn't find anyone to go with them so I went with them all but Bon Jovi in that second one you know when they were the headliner the beginning of the show there's like you know the band is kind of coming out and they're start off the song and I'm like where's John where's John and boom smoke smoke a smoke blast happens on stage and the smoke clears in Bon Jovi is just standing there so he's being Bon Jovi exactly he had a horizontal trap door that would instead of falling through it it would shoot him up neat and an instant and I was even though it's not like I was dying to get to that show I was pretty knocked out I got to say for sure but you better stand exactly where they tell you to stand on that kind of trap door plant I don't think so you don't want to do that it went up with some I think I saw behind the scenes of it one time even it went up with some speed I hope that that was fun yeah so one of the things oh we didn't mention that like there were plenty of people who were in that ring including animals they would have liked to have gotten out of that ring so they prevented this by separating the seating area from the arena floor rather large stone barrier 12 foot stone barrier with a bronze fence on top of that and then on top of that they lined it with elephant tusks so it was not easy yeah to get over but that seating area was like a snapshot of social hierarchy in Rome because they had it very much divided up socially yeah and this like reading this I was kind of like it's sort of exactly how it is today you've got your very very special people are sitting court side down there on the hardwood floor especially in yellow at Jimmy Butler or LeBroner whoever sure senators families obviously in their guests they could bring their own folding chairs which is pretty special at the time and they sure but they also had their box seats you know a little higher up what would we would call like a luxury box today and this is where you know usually see the emperor and emperor's guests just just like you would today any rich or famous person who is a luxury box in their hangers on right came to you imagine those senators to just like a certain individualism like bedazzled some of their seats right that they brought sure so after that I had not heard of this group there there was a social stradden stradden yeah in Rome called they to questions yeah the a question order were people who had originally served in the cavalry and then went on to become extraordinarily prosperous in wealthy business people so there were merchants tradesmen bureaucrats sometimes artisans and the reason that they were taking up the the slack for the business world in Rome is because the senate was forbidden from engaging in business so didn't want the senators tainted so all of that fell to these equestrians who made up that I guess wealthy class but not senators or the emperor yeah so they're like in the what you would call the 100 level seats you move up to the 200 level as far as modern arena's go and then you've got your middle class but within that middle class and the Colosseum it was subdivided more than 300 times for very specific areas for very specific social groups like you know ambassadors are in this section if you're a soldier on leave you're over here if you were a member of some sort of guild in middle class guild then you're sitting over here and then of course you've got your 300 level nosebleeds it's always been that way it'll always be this way you have the cheap seats and it's I don't think it's confirmed but most of these were standing in Rome only at the yeah they they're just basing that on the fact that they're so steep and the seats so shallow it's like it has to be standing remotely yeah and there there were times where it's especially during events that the emperor put on at the Colosseum where you you couldn't leave so if you're uncomfortable to yes you had to stay there and watch because the emperor was putting this on for your benefit who did they ban entirely though that's not done this interesting yeah they they ban grave diggers actors and former gladiators and I just higher low for you know what that what the reason wasn't grave diggers is pretty obvious you know plenty of societies around the world in different times have looked upon grave diggers is basically untouchable like societies unwanted but incredibly necessary right the way you treat incredibly necessary people that's how grave diggers have been treated actors I saw a stack exchange explanation that said that they were viewed as like lowly and untrustworthy and dangerous even maybe and then former gladiators I saw that they were worried that they might attack other people out of revenge or something but the person who gave that answer doubted it so well after what it's worth with a green assault yeah the acting tracks just because it's been well established that acting as a profession was not something that was looked kindly upon or to aspire to for most of its history right but but they were they were considered lowly or then slaves then because the slaves were allowed to go sit in the cheap seats the actors couldn't even come in yeah it's it's strange and I know that Rome had a much different view of their slaves than the West African slave trade that started by the Portuguese and the teens you know 17th century that was I know it's still a lot different but that's still pretty surprising right of course I'm with you so Chuck I mentioned that you didn't have a fine to get a pottery shard that wasn't some random weird thing I was saying earlier that's actually what the tickets were they they had the gate a section in a seat number and described on that little shard of pottery can you believe that they're I mean surely you turned these things back in right I guess but I didn't see any any examples of any that had survived but truly there must be a couple left as many events as were held there I can't imagine they carved you know 50 plus thousand of these for every single event that they had but you know maybe so who knows it was free to get in that's kind of cool you didn't have to pay any money but they were not just anyone could get the tickets they're very much distributed in the sort of the same way the seating was very structured in a higher higher arc of a way the tickets were distributed thusly as well right and you know that's how you got in you got in with your little ticket your little ticket said what gate to go in just like today to get you in as quickly as possible and like you said they got people out of there it seems like pretty quickly the the only thing that was dubious because anytime they say something like very specific like 15 minutes right and it was 2000 years ago I'm always like who he was timing this back then right that's why I was going up to 18 minutes yeah you know I bet it was super speedy though so um one of the other things about it that comes into into play later it was equipped with water founds in flushing toilets so there was running water that could reach the um the call of see-up just yeah but then you're happy for later okay yeah and that also means that during the games there were drunk dudes at uh year-in-als barking out their sports opinions yeah for sure essentially some things never changed some things never changed so um I guess it's finally time we talk about what exactly went on there right yeah I mean when it first opened uh Titus you know if if Dad was still around to see it open at least or was he I did or was he just out of power I don't know I don't think they really curious like stepped out of power much before they died those guys the emperors but uh they said alright big grand opening let's get a hundred straight days of action going every single day for 100 days we're gonna have a big show and a show at the call of see-up was kind of an all day thing um you know after that first 100 days it looks like they basically had stuff during the winter um and then like special events like to celebrate the emperor for big uh you know the birthday's and not you know just any one's birthday but you read it out like a Jackie Jommel or at the call of see-up oh that's funny um but the very first thing that would happen was a procession it was known as a solemn procession had music sort of religious themes and then they started killing animals yeah it's all that they kind of they kind of I guess justified or you know put some sort of a near of salt saying to de-on this by by this whole thing basically having religious themes throughout good for them so yes you're gonna make me talk about the animals huh well I mean I said they killed animals okay I'll go into some of greater detail so what they would do is they would go procure animals from all corners of the Roman Empire subsaharan africa Asia they would bring in tigers lions bear seriously um if they would bring in um elephants they brought in alligators right nasserai just anything can think of any massive exotic animals that's deadly they went and got a bunch of them and brought them back for these events which we should say it took months of planning and a lot of people working on every single one they were like you know half asked one off you know to like a band in the part kind of thing like this was a this is like a really huge event right yeah so um I'm really like that hundred days is just like crazy impressive yes it really is so um they would take these animals and then they would they would convert the arena floor into something like a jungle with potted plants or shrubs or something like that and then they would bring in either animal handlers or hunters venitoris or bisty-r-y who would hunt the animals in front of everybody and it wasn't like any kind of equal stuff but the animals did sometimes kill some of the humans and apparently the the spectators just love that kind of thing sure um yeah I mean they brought them in from all over the world this sort of like a big show of hey look at where we've been look at how vast we are yeah we're not just bringing in local uh the the cats of Rome um yeah you know the kinds of feral cats in Rome you know you can't imagine someone getting killed by a hundred feral cats attacking them though oh that'd be pretty fun yeah I can I can see it now and then sometimes they would have the animals fight one another they would match up you know a cheetah versus a tiger or something like that or an elephant versus a rhinoceros I saw some bear versus python really yeah do you think I really weird and disgusting I wouldn't think that would even work you can't go to python and defyting can you? I saw it written down on the internet shock yeah I can't remember where I saw it but I think it was the legit source yeah no I'm not saying to happen but did you see the yellow preview of the performance and now python didn't do much bear was disinterested one star yeah I wonder like how many of these animals just didn't fight each other and well and I'm sure they forced them to do whatever you know sure they prodded and go to them and you know injured them and did whatever they had to do yeah but they would also just have animal tricks and stuff like that little more circus like atmosphere at times when they weren't killing them or making them kill each other so after this is done enslaved people come out and they clean up hundreds and hundreds of dead animals and I guess break the sand around to mix the blood in and sure the guts and make sure everything was nice and tidy sometimes they would butcher the animals and give out the meat right there so you could be out there for a show in the early afternoon and get a alliance thigh to keep there in the arena for the rest of the day until you can take at home and die of food poisoning. Right I thought about that too there is not a great plan but they sometimes they would feed them real much they did have vending places like what do you call them concessions to hands yeah where you could buy stuff and it was it was like a modern state even a lot of ways again yeah I mean like it's it's so much so that I was like oh okay is football and all like professional sports just all descended from the call of seum and right how did you sneak in your weed I don't think they had to sneak it in back back yeah probably so so after that after they got all the animals cleaned up in the sand rake to all that stuff it was about noon and noon was the time for public executions because the ray they would most people think that gladiator battles were to the death they was actually in frequent as far as gladiator battles went as we'll see but they gave them plenty of of death of humans with these public executions and they would really go to town creating these elaborate deaths like this is a person's death but they would dress them up like icarus and pretend they were flying close to the sun and set them on fire like that kind of stuff yeah um crucifixions hacky to death with a sword these reenactments are just like I had never heard of that before my life i mean it's bad enough to have a public execution but yeah then to make someone reenact some big famous like story from history where the where the hero dies yeah or whatever it's just like it's pretty unbelievable um as far as christians being fed to the lions go that's something that you've heard over and over throughout history um that surely happened but it wasn't like every single time the colosseum had a show they would just throw you know 15 christians out in the middle of a bunch of lions um persecution of christians in uh Rome was happened over the course of a long time and a lot of places here and there but it wasn't like that was what was always happening at the colosseum right um but yes they were they were persecuted and executed for their for their beliefs like it did happen one that was documented with saying Ignatius of anti-ox um and he uh was marked in uh one ten and he was molded by animals like he was torn to pieces by half starved wild animals that were released on him and apparently he had asked friends that in high places not the intercede on his behalf and he didn't fight back by all accounts he just stood there and took it and died um and that happened a lot like there was a there was a lot of christian and Jewish persecution in Rome because they didn't conform to the Roman mythological beliefs right right their panteon of gods um and so they and they were also in the minority and people on the margins have always been persecuted maybe not fed to the lions but um persecuted at least and Rome was no different yeah uh when I worked in New Jersey at the restaurant many years ago that I worked at there was a bartender named Pete and uh foot football game was on in the bar and you walked by and I like hey what's up with the game he would say lions ten christians nothing that was like his go-to line for anybody to test the score oh wow I guess 2000 years later it's not too soon right bro and he always got a chuckle out of most people yeah but probably if it didn't some people sure looking back I thought Pete was so old it's funny I was 25 that that Pete was 32 it is though it's so old when you're in your 20s everybody's still yeah everybody's so oh have you seen that um the new neighbor gatsy special uh yeah are you talking about being like 42 and he thinks he's still young hanging out with the 20s I mean it's pretty big bro comes or is like being an old man received a couple of young guys hanging out over here is good very good he's but then the punch line of that you're not gonna do the punch line I don't remember the punch line I think I was laughing too hard I must have heard it though the punch line is he's like yeah you and young guys just hanging out with him and then he got something like uh and also maybe let's sit down that's right that was a good punch line he's good if your neighbor gets he fan uh he was on episode of movie crush we talked about the movie scream oh that's a good good pick it's a good check it out he's gonna have your not a neighbor get see fan go some of that and go watch the specials yeah he has a blow-up since that movie crush uh appearance that's awesome he's doing a rena's now what is it yes dude he's doing Phillips Arena state burner rena wow on his next show it's crazy and it's great

we talked about this in the Spartan episode we talked about cherry racing and Gladiator's and stuff like that but and that's definitely worth going to listen to if this is if you're like wow ancient romance fascinating you go and learn more about it go listen to our Spartan cassette but there's a lot of misconceptions still one of which like I mentioned is that most Gladiator battles were fights to the death yeah and that's just not how it was in part because of how Gladiators were brought into existence they were usually criminals christeners of war not it looked not not um looked highly upon that's another big misconception too that they were like today's modern MMA fires with all these fans that are like crazy for them not really accurate but that's not to say that some of them didn't make like household names of themselves probably didn't have some fans but it's just not a really apt analogy but as I was saying the the reason why you didn't want to fight to the death is because it took a lot of time and effort and investment to train a prisoner of war or a criminal who had been kidnapped to fight like well and be a Gladiator that's successful so those Gladiators schools were like we're gonna wreck your Gladiators do not let them fight to the you know we want them back rewind first too yeah yeah they're they're trying to put a good product out there because they're charging well they weren't charging money I guess but it was entertainment um and when they're all dying then you're just you know what's gonna happen is all of a sudden it's you know the be team then the seatime is out there right and so yeah they had a lot of time invested in these guys and I say guys because it was 100% men except for when they occasionally had like hey let's bring some women out here to fight is sort of a novelty at kind of thing but the uh Colosseum opened in 80 AD and they organized this um like everything else was organized to the team you know Colosseum wise these these Gladiator battles were organized because they also didn't want to throw in you know uh Russell Crow with uh you know with me because I would get pummeled and die so quickly they wouldn't be any fun for anybody so they organized them by experience level by their skill maybe by how they fought like you don't want to uh grappler in there with a swordsman um although that could be interesting who knows sure uh but they wanted a swordsman against a swordsman and then they had they had four different groups yeah they had um well five they had marmelums which were heavily armored they had um full helmet they had a big old shield they had the Gladiator sword that you think of and then kind of like marmelow 2.0 were threxies where they had a smaller shield and a threxy and sword the curved sword but were very similar to marmelums that's right uh then you had the uh neary gonna leave this to me red ready areias nice I guess um they had lighter armor um these guys had a net and a trident so there was some sort of a nautical theme going on all right so they could like throw a net over someone and try to hit them in the chest uh then you had the chariot um battles the chariot fighters they were the uh acid areias and then finally what do we have the hoppillum moccas nice job I think these are the ones that you think of when you when you think of a Gladiator they had a helmet that had a plume on it they had a spear they had a short sword they had a small round shield I think they had like the shoulder armor okay pretty sure that's what Russell Crowe would have been in Gladiator I haven't seen that's all that wants back then I haven't seen it since then I think I seen it twice but it's been a while for sure yeah I think it was on TNT once and I was watching TNT I think I thought it was pretty good back then but they would so like you said they would they sometimes they would they put a hoppillum moccas against a um ready aris or something like that just to see what happened with one guy with a net and another guy with a spear you know right sure um so they would have him fight like that but like you were saying they they did line them up according to skill level and one thing that that um his bears mentioning so that the events of the Coliseum were free but the Gladiator school still charged to ever was putting on the event or sponsoring the event for renting the Gladiators yeah how did the money work if they weren't making any money did the state just fund it all yes either so so holding an event at the Coliseum free to everybody who could get a ticket 50,000 people um was a really good way of showing everybody how incredibly wealthy you were right or if you were because you collected so many taxes pretty much or if you were the emperor himself it was a way of well it was like a gift to the citizenry as a way to keep them like kind of sedated in line like TV today it's the it's the exact same premise as if you from the emperor's perspective but it was also a way to like generate belovedness and adoration from the populist um by putting on a really good event at the Coliseum yeah it'd be curious about and we probably will never know these specifics but coming from a world of like TV and film production I would love to know how it literally worked as a production like a big production like this with budgets and production managers essentially whatever they call them yeah I mean they had to have people doing all that and I'm sure they were fights over you know what they could afford and what they couldn't yeah like how much money did that kind of have that elephant exactly so we tried it out alligator's three days in a row I can't get another alligator in there we have 97 more days to go wow amazing so um the the I said that the gladiator battles have been around for a while by the time the Coliseum was built been around for at least 300 years they started out as part of funeral games and everybody was like what we'd like this so it kind of became like a thing that wasn't just part of funerals right yeah and some I said some gladiators were like well known and there was one who might have been the most well known of all time as name was flama the flame and apparently he was a captured Syrian soldier did they tell him flamajama I don't know sure surely somebody did okay we are from now on yeah so um he turned down his freedom three different times they would offer you your freedom by giving you a rudice of wooden sword that was symbolic of your transition back into normal society three times he turned it down and finally died in a battle age 35 and um it's long been considered that he was you know just in it for the money or the glory or the fame but somebody um I read suggested that he was doing it because he was trying to um stand for his his um culture because the Romans viewed Syrians very lowly very cowardly and flama the Syrian soldier is like the greatest gladiator in all of Rome so they suggested that that might be why he kept fighting so flama jama was like I'm not taking that wooden sword exactly flamajama doesn't do it's right uh there was also an emperor who got involved a gladiator style um commodus who was a real piece of doo doo um he ran from 180 to 195 and you know it was uh he he didn't really fight people he would go out there you know to boost his own ego apparently hundreds and hundreds of times as a quote unquote gladiator but you know they would submit to him immediately or he they would submit to him and he would just murder them yeah um he had uh like people with disabilities out there dressed up as monsters with sponges painted like rocks you know that supposedly throwing it him and he would hunt them with arrows uh he would come out in public with their blood smeared on him uh he would kill animals he he was just a real awful human being uh there's one story where he supposedly shot 100 bears in one morning yeah and uh he was terrible he yeah to make it even worse he would charge the Roman treasury 25,000 pieces of silver per appearance that he he said I'm going to appear and so give me 25,000 pieces of silver and then there's one other thing that um I want to mention because the Colosseum eventually started to crumble those will talk about in a second but during it's heyday and possibly toward the beginning of it they uh they're contemporary accounts of filling the the Colosseum with water five or six feet deep putting ships in there and staging mock naval battles I'm pretty sure we talked about that in the Spartacus episode or some other episode because it's really familiar um yeah may have happened it definitely happened in an artificial lake made outside of the Colosseum but these these some of these contemporary council like no no we're talking about the Colosseum itself yeah you know what my bet is is that they did it at least once in the Colosseum and we're like this is what what did they call them um nomachias nomachias yeah um that they would uh that they were like we should build our own um place to do this and they built when you're the tiger river yeah that was exclusively for these mock naval battles because I think the Colosseum was probably problematic that would be my guess I think here is story and now but you can stop hauling on to that fact that there was running water that could make it to the Colosseum everybody that's right so I said the Colosseum started to crumble right yeah I mean quite literally uh and metaphorically um you know when the the rise of the Christian church in Rome obviously they would come along and say this kind of brutality can't stand the decline of the Roman Empire period um and you know people weren't as into this stuff it was a moment in time that it was super popular in like any time yeah 400 year moment in time but that would wane and um the first earthquake hit in 443 which damaged it but it was still being used like as an amphitheater I think you know into the 6th century right um and then the medieval period comes along and for about 500 years they made it into sort of like a like a live work place base yeah exactly with shops a warehouses the common area the arena floor became a common area and then it got hit by an earthquake again in 1349 and um the the structure collapse partially and it ended up becoming like uh strip for parts a lot of people scavenged stone from it and other kind of works including our works but also they used it for like building materials too and um they used some of this at the direction of the various poops over the years because they would take in build Christian churches and cathedral with this so because so much of the Colosseum have been used to build churches and because so many Christians have been um killed there the Colosseum itself became kind of a Catholic holy place and became an official holy place in 1749 when Pope Benedict the 14 um blessed it and he said this is now a Christian holy site and that protected it from any more pillaging or destruction and actually led to some early restoration projects yeah so they they started to get to work on it to protect it a little more um after the unification of Italy in 1870 it became you know a legit national monument they you know of course Mussolini comes along and um fully uncovers the uh had you pronounced on a hypogium? That's where I'm going yeah and uh you know further rebuilt it further stabilized it brought out some of the you know restored some of the history for sure and then you know I think it was until like the late 20th century that it you know modern restoration like really nice techniques came along uh to make sure that it was not only safe for tourists but like a robust place to you know keep making money off of or not keep but I guess you know for some of the first times making money off yes some people consider the greatest tours traction of Rome apparently it brings in six million visitors a year and I think there are six million people there when you mean I went that's a lot of people it is a lot um maybe that's why didn't go in it's uh it's very neat though but we didn't make it down to the hypogium I don't know if it was open yet for visitors yeah no 2021 now we definitely weren't able to I would like to go back and go down there yeah I got to pay to go in this time okay I'll cover your admission how about that thank you well since Chuck thanked me everybody that means it's time for listen or mail this is good one this is about skydiving it's okay guys got a good story uh it took my boyfriend now husband and a sister skydiving for his 30 second birthday about 10 years ago in New England and had gone once before so the nerves were gone but I was just full of pure excitement and adrenaline uh it was the middle of having my front tooth replaced DC where this is going yet no no yeah and I had a flipper retainer DC where this is going yet no no yeah okay uh Chuck I think you went through this experience of course I remember the flipper retainer I asked the staff if I should remove it but they said now it's pretty snug in there you'll be fine I was feeling vain and didn't want my toothless face in the video and guess what happened during the free fall I was a little frustrated by needing to interact and entertain to the camera and I really wanted to just enjoy the moment so half jokingly a blue kiss then flipped a bird at the cameraman uh as Instacarmer would have it my fate tooth flew out hypanic and motion to the gap in my mouth to the cameraman and he just gave the thumbs up all good and I remember thinking no not all good uh this just got so much more expensive and I have no tooth and you can even see me sort of looking around for it in mid fall which is not see that coming um I hope that would be magically floating next to me just a plumber to the earth have you amazing uh I just say plumber I think that's pummeled and plummeted at the same time I think that's a great new word you just made uh not my smartest moment but desperation to gover and uh this is from Aaron Bogin and Aaron sent the video which is on YouTube and it's very funny to watch yours you can't see the tooth fly out but you see immediately Aaron grab her mouth and uh motion around and sort of look around and it's just very funny so let me see if I can even find
